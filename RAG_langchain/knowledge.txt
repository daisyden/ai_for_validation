“AssertionError: Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled” could introduced by new unit test case, need unit test owner to add test hook.
“RuntimeError: Required aspect fp64 is not supported on the device” mean the test run on platform without fp64 support, please check whether the test can be run on the platform, or contact unit test owner. 
“AssertionError: Tensor-likes are not close!” means accuracy issue, please check whether the kernel used compiler implementation.
According to #774, “RuntimeError: Double and complex datatype matmul is not supported in oneDNN” depends on oneDNN
According to #1214, exp and log operation has random failure on PVC, investigation is TBD. 
“AssertionError: Tensor-likes are not close!” means accuracy issue, please check whether the kernel used compiler implementation.
According to #774, “RuntimeError: Double and complex datatype matmul is not supported in oneDNN” depends on oneDNN
