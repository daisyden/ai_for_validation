### Merged Result:1618{"issue_number": 1618, "issue_description": "An error occurs during the execution of distributed tests related to FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) compilation. The error message indicates that Torch Dynamo attempted to call a function marked as skipped, specifically `current_stream` from `torch.xpu.__init__.py`. This function was intentionally excluded from tracing, possibly due to compatibility issues or known limitations. The error arises during the backward pass in autograd, where `current_stream()` is called, leading to a runtime exception. The test cases failing include various FSDP compilation tests, such as `test_compiled_autograd_ctx`, `test_dynamo_recompiles_on_fsdp_layer`, and others. The issue is currently open and assigned to `guangyey` for resolution. The root cause appears to be the interaction between Torch Dynamo's tracing mechanism and the XPU's `current_stream` function, which is excluded from tracing, causing the backward pass to fail. The solution likely involves either modifying the tracing rules to include `current_stream` or adjusting the code to avoid calling this function during tracing.\nThe issue is about a problem encountered when tracing functions involving torch.xpu.current_stream() and torch.xpu.stream(). The reporter, zxd1997066, and the assignee, guangyey, are working on this. Daisyden suggested adding torch.xpu.current_stream and torch.xpu.stream to torch_non_c_binding_in_graph_functions to fix the issue. Guangyey agreed and provided a patch.

The error message indicates that the average operation is not supported for the scheduler path in oneCCL. The problem occurs during the execution of two test cases: `test_reduce_scatter_tensor_single` and `test_reduce_scatter_tensor_coalesced`. The error trace shows that the failure originates from the `torch.ops._c10d_functional.reduce_scatter_tensor` and `torch.ops._c10d_functional.reduce_scatter_tensor_coalesced` functions, which are part of the distributed training functionality. Additionally, another test `test_mean` in `test_math_ops.py` also failed due to a related issue during tensor redistribution.\nThe user encountered a RuntimeError during the execution of distributed tensor operations in PyTorch. The error message indicates that the average operation is not supported for the scheduler path in oneCCL. The traceback points to the all_reduce function in the distributed tensor operations, suggesting that the issue arises during the redistribution of tensors across devices. The test cases that failed are test_mean and test_nll_loss_and_cross_entropy, which are part of the distributed tensor math operations tests. The error occurs when trying to perform a reduction operation that involves averaging, which is not currently supported in the scheduler path of oneCCL. The root cause appears to be a missing implementation or a bug in the oneCCL library that prevents the average operation from being handled correctly in distributed training scenarios. The user provided steps to reproduce the issue by running specific tests, which can help in diagnosing and fixing the problem.\nThe issue involves a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) occurring during the execution of the `allgather_into_tensor_coalesced` function in PyTorch's ProcessGroupXCCL implementation. The error is traced back to the oneCCL library, specifically in the `allgatherv_small` function, which is part of the collective communication operations. The root cause appears to be related to improper handling of communication ports or timeouts within the CCL library, leading to a failed port initialization and subsequent crash. The warnings indicate issues with environment variables and port training timeouts, suggesting misconfigurations in the distributed environment setup, possibly due to incorrect MPI or OFI configurations. The problem likely stems from an incompatibility or misconfiguration between the installed oneCCL version and the system's MPI or OFI settings, or an issue within the CCL library itself that prevents proper initialization of communication ports. The solution may involve reconfiguring the environment variables, updating the oneCCL or MPI/OFI components, or applying patches to the affected library functions to handle these cases more gracefully.\nThe reporter of the issue is PenghuiCheng, and the assignee is ratnampa, and the state of the issue is open.\nThe issue involves a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) occurring in multiple threads during the execution of a program using PyTorch and NumPy. The error traces indicate that the fault occurs during a system call related to thread synchronization (`pthread_cond_wait`), which suggests a possible race condition or improper use of shared resources across threads. The problematic code is linked to the `c10` library (part of PyTorch) and the NumPy library's OpenBLAS dependencies. The issue is currently open and is being addressed by the assignee, ratnampa.\nThe issue involves a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) occurring in multiple threads during the execution of a PyTorch script. The error traces indicate that the problem arises from the `pthread_cond_wait` function within the `libc.so.6` library, suggesting a possible race condition or improper synchronization in the code. Additionally, the involvement of the OpenBLAS library points towards a potential issue in the underlying linear algebra operations, possibly related to the interaction between PyTorch and numpy.

### Merged Result:754{"issue_number": 754, "issue_description": "Failures caused by precision error\nThe reporter DaisyDen has raised an issue with the state being open. The issue involves multiple test cases in the extended/test_ops_xpu file, where various operations are compared between CPU and XPU, with specific attention to atol (absolute tolerance) and rtol (relative tolerance) thresholds. The comments include test results with values for atol, rtol, and their respective thresholds, indicating discrepancies in test outcomes between CPU and XPU implementations. The root cause appears to be related to numerical inaccuracies or differences in how certain mathematical functions are implemented or optimized on the XPU hardware compared to CPU. The discrepancies in functions like batch_norm, exp, log, and various special functions (e.g., acos, asin, tanh) suggest issues in the precision or algorithmic differences in the XPU operations. The assignee, DaisyDen, is responsible for investigating and resolving these discrepancies to ensure the XPU operations meet the expected tolerance levels.", "test_cases": "test_reference_numerics_normal_polygamma_polygamma_n_1_xpu_float16, test_reference_numerics_normal_polygamma_polygamma_n_2_xpu_float1, test_reference_numerics_normal_polygamma_polygamma_n_3_xpu_float16, test_reference_numerics_normal_polygamma_polygamma_n_4_xpu_float16, test_comprehensive_nn_functional_nll_loss_xpu_float16\nThe comments list numerous test cases under different categories such as test_ops_xpu, test_binary_ufuncs_xpu, test_nn_xpu, and test_unary_ufuncs_xpu. Each test case specifies the absolute tolerance (atol), relative tolerance (rtol), and their thresholds, indicating the acceptable range of differences between CPU and XPU outputs. For example, test_compare_cpu__batch_norm_with_update_xpu_bfloat16 has an atol of 0.0625 and rtol of 0.023925781, while test_noncontiguous_samples_linalg_tensorsolve_xpu_float32 has a much higher atol of 76586.95313 and rtol of 2.222785473.

Additionally, tests like test_noncontiguous_samples_linalg_tensorsolve_xpu_float32 show extremely high atol and rtol values, which may point to deeper numerical stability issues in certain linear algebra operations on XPU. The presence of 'nan' and 'inf' values suggests that some operations are not handling edge cases or are encountering overflow/underflow scenarios on XPU but not on CPU.", "reporter": "daisyden", "assignee": "daisyden", "resolution": "\nThe resolution involves adjusting the implementation of XPU operations to better align with CPU behavior, particularly in handling special cases and improving numerical precision.

The body of the issue instructs to skip the model in pre-ci and to retrieve the case if Triton gets fixed, implying that the fix might be pending on the Triton repository's resolution. However, specific details like the exact error messages, test cases, and the root cause aren't provided in the given prompt, so those fields are left empty. The JSON maintains a clean structure with only the necessary information extracted from the prompt without adding any unrelated data.\nThis issue has been fixed in the latest Triton main branch. We'll update Triton to resolve this issue.", "test_cases": "\nThe model can pass accuracy tests on the currently pinned Triton now.

### Merged Result:302{"issue_number": 302, "issue_description": "The issue is about evaluating gaps in the test_torch.py file for the XPU backend in PyTorch. The reporter, Daisy Den, has identified several missing functionalities and errors that prevent certain tests from passing. These include missing memory check functions, missing sync guard functionality, and missing tensor and storage types for XPU. Additionally, there are errors related to the absence of certain attributes in the XPU module, such as 'is_xpu' in TypedStorage and 'FloatTensor', 'DoubleTensor', etc. There are also test failures due to incorrect scalar types and assertions not being met.\nThe reporter Daisy Den is encountering multiple test failures while evaluating gaps in test_torch.py. The issue involves errors such as tensor comparison failures, type errors related to CPU-only functions, assertion errors, attribute errors, and not implemented errors. The errors occur in various test cases including test_bernoulli_edge_cases, test_broadcast_fn_map2_xpu, test_discontiguous_out_cumsum_xpu, test_exponential_no_zero_xpu_float16, test_grad_scaler_pass_itself_xpu, and others. The errors suggest missing or incorrect implementations for XPU operations, such as 'aten::_copy_from_and_resize' and 'aten::_sparse_coo_tensor_with_dims_and_tensors', which are not available for the CPU backend. Additionally, there are issues with functions like GradScaler and assertions in test cases.

### Merged Result:271{"issue_number": 271, "issue_description": "The reporter DaisyDen has raised an issue regarding failing gradcheck tests in test_ops_gradients.py. The issue involves several test cases where the gradients computed on XPU do not match the CPU gradients, leading to Jacobian mismatches. The error messages indicate discrepancies between numerical and analytical Jacobians, suggesting issues with the gradient computation or the underlying operations on the XPU. Some tests are failing due to unsupported operations in oneDNN, such as complex128 matrix multiplication and vector normalization, while others are failing because of fallback mechanisms in functions like RReLU and GroupNorm. The root cause appears to be a combination of unsupported operations in the oneDNN library and potential issues in the fallback mechanisms for certain PyTorch operations. The assignee, ZhiweiYan-96, is working on resolving these issues by addressing the unsupported operations and ensuring that the fallback mechanisms are correctly handling the computations, particularly for functions like RReLU and GroupNorm.

### Merged Result:264{"issue_number": 264, "issue_description": "1. torch.random.fork_rng(devices=rng_device) does not support XPU backend. TestRandomTensorCreationXPU.test_randperm_xpu failed with an error indicating that CUDA is not enabled, even though the test is intended for XPU. This suggests that the function is incorrectly trying to use CUDA backend code when running on XPU. 2. torch.xpu.FloatTensor is not supported. Tests like test_tensor_factory_gpu_type_inference and test_constructor_dtype had to be disabled because of this. 3. Multiple devices are not fully supported. When using ZE_AFFINITY_MASK to specify multiple devices, only xpu:0 is detected. This affects tests like test_copy_from_tensor_mult_devices and test_copy_from_dlpack_mult_devices. 4. RuntimeError: 'eq_xpu' not implemented for 'UInt16' in test_cat_out_fast_path_dim0_dim1_xpu_uint16, test_cat_out_fast_path_dim0_dim1_xpu_uint32, and test_cat_out_fast_path_dim0_dim1_xpu_uint64. These tests fail because the 'eq_xpu' function does not handle UInt16, UInt32, and UInt64 data types.\nThe issue involves problems in test_tensor_creation_ops.py, specifically with float to int conversion tests failing for certain integer types. The errors occur when comparing tensors on the XPU device. The test cases `test_float_to_int_conversion_finite_xpu_int16` and `test_float_to_int_conversion_finite_xpu_int8` are failing due to tensor comparison mismatches. Additionally, there's an issue with the `test_tensor_ctor_device_inference_xpu` test failing because the sparse tensor creation function isn't implemented for the XPU backend. The error messages indicate tensor-like comparisons failing with absolute and relative differences, and a NotImplementedError for sparse tensor operations.\nThe issue involves problems with tensor creation operations on XPU devices, specifically related to float to int conversion and unsupported operations. There are errors in tests such as test_cat_out_fast_path_dim0_dim1_xpu_uint16, test_kaiser_window_xpu, and test_float_to_int_conversion_finite_xpu_int16, test_float_to_int_conversion_finite_xpu_int8.
