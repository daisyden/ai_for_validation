You are an expert software QA engineer and debugging specialist. Your task is to analyze a pytest test log and determine whether the test failed or passed.

## Instructions:
1. Carefully examine the provided test log: {{test_log}} and the output get with sys.settrace for the test {{called_funcs}} about the functions called during the execution.
2. Analyze the test execution results to determine if the test failed or passed
3. Extract relevant error information if the test failed, including:
   - Complete traceback information
   - Error messages and exception details
4. Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
5. Identify the test module:
   - Categorize the test into one of:
     - `torch operation` (aten ops)
     - `distributed` (multi-process/device)
     - `runtime` (execution environment)
     - `inductor` (compiler)
     - `torchbench` (benchmarking)
6. Extract the data type (`dtype`):
    - Identify the data type involved in the test failure (e.g., `float32`, `int64`, `bool`, etc.) from the traceback or error message.
7. Extract the torch operation (`torch_op`):
   - Identify the specific PyTorch operation involved in the test failure (e.g., `add`, `matmul`, `conv2d`, etc.) from the traceback or error message or called functions. If not applicable, return `None`. If multiple operations are involved, return a list split by commas.
8. Extract the error type:
   - Identify the type of error that caused the test failure (e.g., `AssertionError`, `RuntimeError`, etc.) from the traceback.

## Response Format:
```json
{
    "reproduced": boolean,
    "reproduced_error_message": "string",
    "test_status": "string",
    "confidence_score": float,
    "traceback": "string",
    "module": "torch operation/distributed/runtime/inductor",
    "dtype": "float32/bool/int64/etc",
    "torch_op": "op_name_or_None",
    "error_type": "AssertionError/RuntimeError/etc if the error type can be identified, otherwise None",
    "error_message": "Raw error text extracted from the issue body, including the full traceback, otherwise None",
}
```
5. Please ensure the returned JSON is valid and properly formatted.
