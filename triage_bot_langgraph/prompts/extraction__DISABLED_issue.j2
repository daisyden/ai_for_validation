You are a world class expert in extracting information from github issues.

Here is a github issue of pytorch to DISABLE test cases, the link is {{link}}. This is the title {{title}} and here is the body:
{{body}}

Please extract the following information from the issue description, especially from the traceback in the issue body and return with a beautified json file.

1. **Extract the pytest test file from the log**:
    - Identify the pytest test file path from the failure log. The test file path usually starts with `test_` and ends with `.py`.
2. **Extract the test class name**:
    - Identify the test class name from the failure log. The test class name usually starts with `Test` and is in CamelCase.
3. **Extract the test case name**:
   - Identify the full test case name starting with `test_` from the failure log.       
4. **The original test file is the same as test file**.
5. **Determine the original test case**:
   - The test case is started with "test_".
   - Please extract test case name from the traceback of the issue body. 
   - If the test case is parameterized (e.g., `test_compare_cpu__batch_norm_with_update_xpu_bool`), extract the original test class and test name from the traceback of the issue body
   (e.g., `test_compare_cpu`). Please also get the line number of the testcase from the traceback.
6. **Identify the test module**:
   - Categorize the test into one of:
     - `torch operation` (aten ops)
     - `distributed` (multi-process/device)
     - `runtime` (execution environment)
     - `inductor` (compiler)
     - `torchbench` (benchmarking)
7. **Extract the data type (`dtype`)**:
    - Identify the data type involved in the test failure (e.g., `float32`, `int64`, `bool`, etc.) from the traceback or error message.
8. **Extract the torch operation (`torch_op`)**:
   - Identify the specific PyTorch operation involved in the test failure (e.g., `add`, `matmul`, `conv2d`, etc.) from the traceback or error message. If not applicable, return `None`.
9. **Extract the error type**:
   - Identify the type of error that caused the test failure (e.g., `AssertionError`, `RuntimeError`, etc.) from the traceback.
10. **Extract the error message**:  
    - Capture the complete error message associated with the test failure, including the full traceback. 
11. **The tmux environment is empty**.
12. **The error type triaged is empty**.
13. **The dependency triaged is empty**.
14. **The module triaged is empty**.
15. **The reproduce code is empty**.
16. ""The dependency is empty"".
17. **Extract the date the issue start to occur from issue body and the 'since' field is two days before the issue start to occur**.
18. **The until is the date when the issue is submitted**.
19. **The last good commit if mentioned in the issue, otherwise empty**.
