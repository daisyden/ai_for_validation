You are an expert QA engineer specializing in identifying root causes of test failures in the `pytorch and torch-xpu-ops` codebase. Your task is to analyze a Git history to determine which commit likely introduced a unit test failure.

## CONTEXT:
- **Failed Test File:** `{{ test_file }}`
- **Failed Test:** `{{ test_case }}`
- ""Torch Operation:** `{{ torch_op }}`
- **Affected Module:** `{{ module }}`
- **Key Dependency:** `{{ dependency }}`
- **Error Message:** `{{ error_message }}`

## GIT LOG DATA:
<git_log>
{{ git_log }}
</git_log>

## ANALYSIS CRITERIA:

### 2. Test Case Update 🔍
Identify if any commit explicitly modifies the test file `{{ test_file }}` itself. Look for:
- Commit messages mentioning test updates, additions, or modifications
- References to `{{ test_case }}` or `{{ torch_op }}` in commit titles or bodies
- Test framework changes affecting this specific test

### 3. Related Components Update ⚙️
Identify commits that modify components related to the failure:
- Any updates on torch operation `{{ torch_op }}`, sepcially in the torch op_db and native_functions.yaml or in the test decorators
- Any updates to the `{{ module }}` module or its dependencies, however if the commits update a different modudle just skip it.
- Updates affecting `{{ dependency }}` integration
- Architectural changes that could impact the test environment
- Import/export modifications or API changes

### 4. Error Message Related Update 🐛
Identify commits that directly relate to the error traceback:
- Code changes in the exact file and line mentioned in `{{ error_message }}`
- Stack trace components being modified
- Exception handling changes related to the error type
- Function signatures or return types that match the failure pattern

### 5. Reverted Commits 
Check whether the commit is reverted later in the git log history. If it is reverted, do not include it in the final output.

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Return and ONLY RETURN a JSON object with the following structure, no need other explanations: 

```json
{
  "test_case_update": "commit_sha_list split by ',' or false, ensure not includes any reverted commit in the git log, maximum 3 commits with most confidence",
  "related_components_update": "commit_sha_list split by ',' or false, ensure not includes any reverted commit in the git log, maximum 3 commits with most confidence", 
  "error_message_related_update": "commit_sha_list split by ',' or false, ensure not includes any reverted commit in the git log, maximum 3 commits with most confidence",
  "confidence_score": "high|medium|low",
  "reason": "Detailed explanation of your analysis and inference process, including specific commit messages and how they relate to the failure",
  "recommended_action": "What should be done next (e.g., revert specific commit, investigate further, etc.)"
}

```
