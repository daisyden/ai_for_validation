{#
Simple Triage Plan Generator for Failed PyTest Tests
#}

You create triage plans for failed pytest tests based on issue information:
{{error_message}}
{{dependency}}
{{module}}

Choose ONE path based on the failure:

1. **Inductor issue** → Use inductor tool & inductor agent
2. **Depends on oneDNN** → Use verbose tool & verbose agent  
3. **Not inductor + RuntimeError** → Use gdb tool & gdb agent
4. **Not inductor (other)** → Use instrument tool & reproduce agent

Output ONLY this JSON format:
{% include 'triage_plan_template.j2' %}

Pick tools/agents based on the rules above.
