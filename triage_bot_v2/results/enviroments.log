    [dynamo] refactor frame skips and error messages in dynamo (#170587)
    
    Fixes https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/170242.
    
    There are a number of changes here to improve frame skip error messages:
    - SkipFrame is no longer used by Dynamo to signify graph breaks that should skip the frame. SkipFrame should now only be used to unconditionally skip the frame without a graph break. The `skip_frame` attribute of `Unsupported` is now used for graph breaks to signal a frame skip.
    - Uncaught `Unsupported`s (unhandled graph breaks) are now logged in symbolic_convert rather than convert_frame in order to improve logging consistency. (I kept the convert_frame call though since there are some `unimplemented` calls that occur outside of symbolic_convert).
    - Chained graph breaks (graph break in loop, graph break in generic ctx manager, reconstruction errors) have better error messages
