It says Torch isn't compiled with CUDA enabled. That makes me think the test is trying to use CUDA functionality, but Torch wasn't built with CUDA support.

Issue 1196 mentions skipping CUDA tests because XPU doesn't support certain features.

It says that `torch._C` doesn't have the attribute `_cuda_tunableop_enable`. That suggests that the code is trying to access a function or variable from PyTorch's C extensions that doesn't exist. Maybe this attribute was removed or never existed in the version being used.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see several issues related to XPU devices. For example, issue 221 mentions enabling XPU support and a runtime error about device types. Issue 220 is about a core dump in `TestIndexingXPU`, which is a different test but also XPU-related. Issue 302 lists several missing functionalities needed for XPU testing, including memory checks and tensor support. Issue 128 talks about failures due to missing implementations in `torch-xpu-ops`.\n\nThe error in the question seems to be about a missing attribute in `torch._C`. I know that `torch._C` is part of PyTorch's C API, and sometimes certain functions or attributes are only available for specific backends like CUDA. The error message mentions `_cuda_tunableop_enable`, which sounds like it's related to CUDA's tunable operators. Maybe the XPU backend doesn't have this attribute, or it's not properly integrated.\n\nI should check if `_cuda_tunableop_enable` is a CUDA-specific function. If it's only available for CUDA, then trying to use it on XPU would cause this error. Perhaps the test is incorrectly assuming that this attribute exists for XPU, or the XPU backend hasn't implemented it yet.\n\nLooking at the search results, issue 302 mentions that some functionalities are missing in the XPU backend, like `torch.cuda.memory_allocated()` and others. It also points out that `torch.xpu` is missing some attributes, like `FloatTensor` and `amp`. This suggests that the XPU backend might not have all the features that CUDA has, leading to such errors when tests are run.\n\nSo, putting it together, the test is probably trying to use a CUDA-specific feature (`_cuda_tunableop_enable`) on the XPU device, which doesn't have that attribute. This would cause the AttributeError. The root cause is likely an incomplete implementation of the XPU backend, missing certain CUDA features that the test expects to be present.\n\nTo fix this, the XPU backend needs to either implement the `_cuda_tunableop_enable` functionality or the test should be adjusted to handle cases where this attribute isn't available. Alternatively, the test might need to be skipped or modified for XPU devices until the necessary support is added.\n</think>\n\nThe failed unit test `test_gemm_bias_tunableop_xpu_bfloat16` is encountering an `AttributeError` because the XPU backend lacks support for the CUDA-specific `_cuda_tunableop_enable` attribute.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the error message is pointing to an issue with `torch._C`, which is PyTorch's C extension module. The specific error is that it can't find the attribute `_cuda_tunableop_enable`. This suggests that the test is trying to access a function or variable that doesn't exist in that module.\n\nLooking at the test name, it mentions `xpu`, which stands for Intel's oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) accelerated computing. So, this test is likely related to operations that run on the XPU device. The test is part of `test_linalg_xpu`, which probably tests linear algebra operations on XPU.\n\nI recall that in PyTorch, certain operations might require specific backend support. The error message mentions `_cuda_tunableop_enable`, which sounds like it's related to CUDA, but the test is for XPU. Maybe the test is incorrectly referencing CUDA-specific code instead of using the correct XPU backend functions.\n\nLooking at the search results provided, I see several issues related to XPU testing. For example, issue 221 mentions enabling mode supports XPU device and a RuntimeError because the mode only supports CPU and CUDA. Issue 220 talks about a core dump in `TestIndexingXPU` due to issues with global and local IDs. Issue 128 lists several test failures due to missing implementations in `torch-xpu-ops`, some of which are linked to GitHub issues.\n\nFrom this, I can infer that there might be missing or incorrect references to XPU-specific functions in the test. The test might be trying to use a CUDA-specific function or variable, which doesn't exist for XPU. Alternatively, the `torch.xpu` module might not have the necessary attributes or methods implemented yet.\n\nAnother possibility is that the `torch._C` module hasn't been updated to include support for the XPU's tunable operations, leading to the missing attribute error. This could mean that the underlying C++ code in PyTorch's backend doesn't expose the necessary functions to the Python bindings, causing the AttributeError when the test tries to access it.\n\nTo resolve this, I should check if the `torch._C._cuda_tunableop_enable` is actually needed for XPU operations. If it's a CUDA-specific function, the test shouldn't be using it. Instead, it should utilize the appropriate XPU backend functions. Alternatively, if the XPU backend requires a similar function, it might need to be implemented and exposed correctly in `torch._C`.\n\nI should also look into whether there are any known issues or pull requests related to this specific test or the functions it's using. Maybe there's an existing issue where developers are working on implementing the necessary XPU support for these operations, which would explain why the test is failing.\n\nIn summary, the failure is likely due to the test incorrectly referencing a CUDA-specific attribute in `torch._C` when it should be using XPU-specific functions. The solution would involve updating the test to use the correct XPU backend functions or ensuring that the necessary attributes are properly implemented and exposed in the XPU backend of PyTorch.\n</think>\n\nThe failed unit test `test_scaled_gemm_tunableop_xpu_float8_e5m2fnuz` is encountering an `AttributeError` because it references a CUDA-specific attribute `_cuda_tunableop_enable` in `torch._C`, which isn't available for XPU operations.

Let me start by understanding what this error means.\n\nFrom the error message, it looks like there's a discrepancy between the expected output's metadata (like shape and device) and the actual output's metadata. This often happens when there's a mismatch in how tensors are handled, especially when moving between different devices or when using certain optimizations.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see a few relevant issues. The first one is issue 1432, which mentions a similar error with `RuntimeError: output 1: meta disagrees with real impl` in the context of SDPA cases failing after enabling XPU in PyTorch. The root cause there was NaN outputs for fully masked rows, and the assignee was LuFinch. This seems related because both issues involve XPU and attention mechanisms.\n\nAnother relevant issue is 1237, which also involves test failures in `test_native_mha_xpu.py`, specifically with multihead attention. The error there was about tensor-like elements not being close, which could indicate an issue with how the attention outputs are computed or compared.\n\nI also notice issue 1431, which has a different error about `to_padded_tensor` requiring a non-zero constituent tensor. While this isn't directly about attention, it could be a related issue if the problem is with tensor handling on the XPU.\n\nPutting this together, the most likely cause for the failing test is a mismatch in tensor metadata when using XPU, possibly due to how attention masks are handled or how the attention outputs are computed. The fact that issue 1432 was about NaN outputs in fully masked rows suggests that when certain conditions are met (like all attention masks being True), the output might not be handled correctly, leading to the metadata mismatch.\n\nSo, the root cause is probably related to how the attention outputs are being computed or compared when using XPU, especially in cases where attention masks are applied.

It mentions that the output's meta data doesn't match the real implementation. The error points to `aten._scaled_dot_product_fused_attention_overrideable.default`, which suggests it's related to attention mechanisms in transformers. The error also says that the expected shape was `(4, 4, 3)` but the real shape was empty, which is `torch.Size([])`. That seems like a shape mismatch issue.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see a few relevant issues. Issue 1432 is about SDPA cases failing after enabling XPU in PyTorch. The error message there is similar, mentioning a shape mismatch in the attention function. The root cause was NaN outputs for fully masked rows, and the assignee is LuFinch.

The root cause is NaN outputs in certain rows, likely due to how attention is computed when all elements are masked. The solution mentioned is related to OneDNN support, but I'm not sure if that's fully implemented yet.\n\nTo fix this, I think the attention computation needs to handle cases where all elements are masked to prevent NaN outputs. Maybe adding a small value before applying softmax could help. Alternatively, ensuring that the implementation correctly handles these edge cases when using XPU.\n\nI should suggest looking into the attention layer's implementation, specifically how it deals with masked values.

The specific tensors involved have different shapes: one is `torch.Size([4, 4, 3])` and the other is `torch.Size([])`. \n\nHmm, the error mentions `test_dispatch_meta_outplace_norm_fro_xpu_bfloat16`, which suggests it's related to the Frobenius norm calculation on XPU devices using the BFloat16 data type. I remember that BFloat16 is a mixed-precision data type, so maybe there's an issue with how the data is being handled during the computation.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see a few relevant issues. Issue 1432 talks about SDPA cases failing after enabling XPU in PyTorch, with NaN outputs for fully masked rows. That's a bit different, but it also involves XPU and some kind of output issue.

To resolve this, ensure the normalization function correctly handles BFloat16 and verify that the meta data matches the real implementation.

Let me start by understanding the error message. The traceback mentions `RuntimeError: Native API failed. Native API returns: 2147483646 (UR_RESULT_ERROR_UNKNOWN)`. That error code, 2147483646, is a hexadecimal value that translates to 0x8000002, which usually indicates an unknown error in the UR library, which is part of the Intel oneAPI DPC++ Runtime.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see that there's an existing issue #1236 where a similar error occurred in `test_max_pool_nan_inf_xpu_float64`. The issue was closed, and the resolution mentioned testing in a specific environment. The reporter was daisyden, and the assignee was Stonepia. The problem was related to max pooling with NaN and inf values on XPU, which suggests that the issue might be related to how the pooling operations handle special floating-point values.\n\nIn the current failing test, it's `test_maxpool3d_non_square_backward_xpu`. The fact that it's a maxpool3d test and involves the backward pass might mean that the problem is occurring during gradient computation. The error could be due to how the XPU handles certain operations during backpropagation, especially if the input has NaNs or infs, which can cause issues in computations.\n\nI should check if there are any known issues related to maxpool3d or 3D pooling operations on XPU. From the search results, issue #1236 is the closest match, even though it's for a different test. The root cause there was an environment-specific issue, but since the current test is also in the pooling module, it's possible that a similar underlying problem exists.\n\nAnother angle is to look at the implementation of the maxpool3d operation on XPU. If the backward pass isn't correctly handling certain edge cases, like when the input contains NaNs or infs, it could lead to this UR error. The test might be triggering a scenario where the pooling operation isn't properly computing the gradients, leading to an invalid state in the underlying runtime.\n\nI should also consider if there are any recent changes in the PyTorch or XPU-ops repository that might have introduced this regression. If the issue is new, perhaps it's a bug introduced in a recent commit. However, since the search results don't mention any other issues related to maxpool3d, I'll focus on the known issue #1236 as a potential known issue.\n\nIn summary, the failing test likely relates to an issue where the XPU's handling of max pooling operations, especially during the backward pass, leads to an unknown error in the UR runtime. This could be due to how special values are handled or how the gradients are computed.

However, this isn't the same test as the one we're looking at, so maybe not directly relevant.\n\nNext, there's a result with issue 1237.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when a test fails with \"Tensor-likes are not close!\", it usually means that two tensors that are supposed to be equal (or very close) have some differences that are beyond the allowed tolerance. In this case, the test is comparing the output of some unary ufunc on XPU with the expected result, probably on CPU, and they're not matching up as they should.\n\nLooking at the test name, `test_reference_numerics_extremal_exp_xpu_complex64`, it seems like it's testing the exponential function (`exp`) on XPU with extremal values, which might include very large or very small numbers, or maybe even complex numbers since it's `complex64`. The fact that it's failing suggests there's an issue with how the `exp` function is handling these edge cases on XPU.\n\nI remember that in the past, there have been issues with numerical precision differences between CPU and GPU (or in this case, XPU) computations. Maybe the XPU implementation of `exp` isn't handling certain complex numbers correctly, leading to small discrepancies that cause the test to fail.\n\nI should check if there are any known issues related to `exp` on XPU, especially with complex numbers. From the search results provided, I see issues like #669, #1400, and #1401, which are about different parts of the codebase but all involve tensor comparisons failing. However, none of these are directly related to the `exp` function or complex numbers.\n\nSo, it's possible that this is a new issue. The root cause might be a bug in the XPU kernel for the `exp` function when dealing with extremal or edge cases, especially with complex64 numbers. Maybe the precision isn't sufficient, or there's a miscalculation in certain ranges.\n\nTo resolve this, I would suggest a few steps:\n1. **Investigate the specific inputs causing the failure.** Are there particular complex numbers where the `exp` function on XPU is giving incorrect results?\n2. **Compare the CPU and XPU outputs in detail.** Look at the exact differences to see if they're within acceptable numerical ranges or if there's a pattern indicating a deeper issue.\n3. **Review the XPU kernel implementation for `exp`.** Ensure that it's correctly handling all edge cases, especially for complex numbers.\n4. **Consider adjusting the tolerance levels.** If the differences are minor and within acceptable numerical limits, maybe the test's tolerance needs to be adjusted.\n5. **File a new issue if necessary.** If this is a new problem not covered by existing issues, creating a new report with detailed information would help the developers address it.\n\nI should also think about whether this is a known issue.

The error message suggests that Ninja isn't installed or isn't available when running the test. I remember that when setting up PyTorch from source, you often need to install Ninja separately because it's not included in the standard dependencies.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see that there are several issues related to `test_autograd_xpu.py`, but none of them mention the Ninja error.

So, it seems like this specific error isn't a known issue in the provided context.\n\nI should consider the environment setup. Maybe the user didn't install Ninja before running the tests. PyTorch requires Ninja for building certain components, especially when using features that rely on C++ extensions, which might be the case here with autograd and XPU testing.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user installed PyTorch without compiling from source, relying on a pre-built binary.

It says that the `_thnn_fused_lstm_cell` operator isn't implemented for the CPU backend. That's a bit confusing because I thought XPU was supposed to be the target here. Maybe the test is trying to run on CPU instead of XPU, but the issue is about the LSTM cell not being supported on XPU.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see that issue #1231 mentions the same error but for the XPU device. It says that the LSTM operator isn't implemented for XPU and suggests using a CPU fallback. The resolution there was that the operator was cherry-picked into the release, so it's fixed. \n\nBut in this case, the error is about the CPU backend. That's odd because if the test is supposed to run on XPU, why is it hitting a CPU issue? Maybe the test isn't correctly setting up the device, or there's a fallback happening. \n\nI also notice that issue #231 had issues with XPU tests failing due to device type handling.

Let me start by looking through the provided search results to see if any similar issues are mentioned.\n\nLooking at the merged results, I see several issues with test failures, but none of them mention the `test_unary_ufuncs_xpu.py` test or the `acos` function. The first result, issue 669, is about `test_module_xpu.py` failing with `ConvTranspose3d`, which is a different test and operation. Issue 676 is about `TestMatmulCudaXPU` failing, again a different test. Issue 674 involves page faults in elementwise operations, which doesn't match. The last one, issue 1401, is about `test_weight_norm.py` failing, which is also unrelated.\n\nSince none of the search results mention the specific test that failed in the question, I can infer that this might not be a known issue yet. The failure message mentions an assertion error where tensor-like values aren't close, which usually points to numerical discrepancies. For the `acos` function, possible causes could include differences in the implementation between CPU and XPU, precision issues, or specific edge cases not handling correctly on XPU.\n\nTo resolve this, I would suggest checking the implementation of the `acos` function on XPU against the CPU version for consistency. It might also be helpful to compare the input data and the computed outputs in more detail to identify where the discrepancy arises. Additionally, reviewing any recent changes in the XPU backend that could affect the `acos` operation would be important.

For example, issue 669 mentions a failure in `test_module_xpu.py` with a ConvTranspose3d operation, and it's closed with a resolution involving skipping the test and adjusting tolerance. Issue 1401 is about `test_weight_norm.py` failing with a tensor comparison error and is still open. Issues 676 and 674 also have tensor-related failures but are resolved.\n\nThe new test failure is about `test_compare_cpu_nn_functional_softshrink_xpu_bfloat16`. The error is an assertion that tensors aren't close, which is a common issue in numerical stability tests, especially when comparing CPU and XPU outputs. The root cause could be related to precision differences, especially since it's using bfloat16, which has lower precision than float32.\n\nI don't see an exact match for this specific test in the provided results, so it's not a known issue yet. However, the pattern suggests it might be a precision issue. The Softshrink function's implementation on XPU might not perfectly match CPU, leading to small discrepancies that fail the assertion.\n\nTo resolve this, I'd recommend checking the numerical precision of the Softshrink implementation on XPU. Maybe adjusting the tolerance in the test or improving the XPU implementation to better match CPU results could help.

Native API returns: -36 (PI_ERROR_INVALID_QUEUE)\". Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I remember that PI_ERROR_INVALID_QUEUE usually relates to issues with queues in the context of parallel computing, maybe something to do with devices or kernels not launching properly. The error occurred when moving a tensor from device 0 to device 1 and trying to print it. That makes me think it's related to inter-device operations.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see that issue 745 has a similar error. The description mentions the same error code and the same scenario of moving a tensor between devices. The root cause there was related to launching a kernel on a specific tile, which suggests it's a hardware or driver issue, possibly with multiple devices. The resolution noted that this is common in setups with multiple devices, like an iGPU and dGPU, which aligns with the user's case.\n\nSo, putting it together, the failed test is likely encountering the same known issue. The error is due to an invalid queue when trying to launch a kernel on a specific device after moving the tensor. The solution would involve checking the device setup and ensuring that the kernel launches correctly across devices, possibly by updating drivers or adjusting how tensors are moved between devices.\n</think>\n\nThe failed unit test is a known issue (Issue ID: 745).

The error message says there's an assertion error because the tensor-like objects aren't close enough. Specifically, 540 out of 640 elements mismatch, which is a pretty high percentage. The greatest absolute difference is about 5.28e-5, and the relative difference is around 2.10e-6. \n\nLooking at the provided search results, I see that there's a similar issue with `ConvTranspose3d` in issue 669. The reporter was mengfei25, and it was assigned to daisyden. The issue was closed, and the resolution mentioned skipping the test and working on tolerance changes. The root cause wasn't clearly stated, but it was related to non-contiguous tensors and ConvTranspose3d.\n\nNow, the current issue is about `LazyConv3d`, which is another convolution operation. The error seems to be related to tensor non-contiguity, which might cause the convolution results to differ when the tensors aren't contiguous in memory. The high mismatch rate suggests that the non-contiguous tensors are causing significant discrepancies in the output.\n\nI'm thinking that the root cause might be similar to issue 669, where the handling of non-contiguous tensors in the ConvTranspose3d operation caused test failures. Perhaps the same issue is affecting LazyConv3d now. The problem could be related to how the XPU backend handles non-contiguous tensors during the convolution operations, leading to incorrect results or precision issues.\n\nThe solution might involve adjusting the tolerance levels for the tensor comparisons, similar to what was done in issue 669. Alternatively, there might be a need to ensure that the tensors are properly contiguous before performing the convolution operations, or to fix the underlying convolution implementation to handle non-contiguous tensors correctly.\n\nSince the issue is new, I should check if there are any recent changes in the codebase that might have introduced this regression. If not, then it's likely a known issue that needs to be addressed by adjusting tolerances or fixing the convolution handling for non-contiguous tensors.\n</think>\n\nThe failed test `test_non_contiguous_tensors_nn_LazyConv3d_xpu_float32` in `test_modules_xpu.py` is likely a known issue related to non-contiguous tensors affecting convolution operations.
