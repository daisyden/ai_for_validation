### Merged Result:585{"issue_number": 585, "issue_description": "Pytorch compilation fail on assertion\nPytorch compilation fail on assertion\nThe reporter ZzEeKkAa is encountering a build issue with PyTorch using the latest Intel XPU operations. The issue was closed, and the assignee, Stonepia, provided a solution involving setting the DEBUG flag and avoiding conda's gcc/g++. ZzEeKkAa shared a detailed build log showing the compilation process with specific flags and paths. The root cause appears to be incorrect compiler flags leading to build failures, particularly related to the inclusion of conda's gcc/g++. The solution suggests using system compilers instead of conda's to resolve the build issues.\nThe issue involves a compilation error in the SparseCsrTensor.cpp file during the build process of the torch-xpu-ops repository. The error occurs due to a non-constexpr function call in the op_allowlist_check macro, leading to an assertion failure. The error message indicates that the function __assert_fail is called, which is not allowed in a constexpr context. The warning messages point to potential issues with dangling references to temporary objects in the IListRef_inl.h and DispatchKeyExtractor.h files, but these do not directly cause the build failure. The root cause of the issue is the use of an assertion in the op_allowlist_check macro, which is not compatible with the constexpr context where it is being used. The fix likely involves modifying the macro to avoid using non-constexpr functions or ensuring that the assertion is placed in a context where it can be evaluated at runtime instead of compile-time.\nThe issue involves a warning about a possibly dangling reference to a temporary variable and an error related to a non-constexpr function call during the build process of the SparseCsrTensor.cpp file. The error occurs in the op_allowlist.h file where an assertion fails because the function is not marked as constexpr. The user is following the PyTorch contribution guide and using cmake arguments that might be causing the issue.\nThe reporter is encountering a build error when trying to set up PyTorch with XPU support. The error occurs during the compilation of SparseCsrTensor.cpp, specifically a warning that escalates to a build failure. The user provided detailed cmake commands and build logs showing the error messages related to temporary references in the code.\nThe issue arises from the use of `assert()` within a `constexpr` function in PyTorch's `op_allowlist_check`. This leads to a compilation error when the function is evaluated at compile-time, as `assert()` is not a `constexpr` function. The root cause is that `assert()` is a runtime function, and its use inside a `constexpr` context causes a non-constexpr function call, which is not allowed. The solution is to replace `assert()` with `static_assert()` or another compile-time assertion mechanism to ensure the checks are performed at compile-time without invoking runtime functions.\nThe reporter is ZzEeKkAa, the assignee is Stonepia, and the issue is closed. The issue involves a function `constexpr bool op_allowlist_check(string_view op_name)` which includes an `assert` statement checking for the presence of `::` in `op_name` and another `assert` ensuring that `op_name` does not contain `(`. The comments reference a GCC bug related to using `throw()` in `constexpr` functions and point to workarounds using `assert()`.

The reporter was instructed to set the DEBUG flag and ensure that the build environment uses the correct compiler flags by referencing a successful build's configuration.\nThe fix involves modifying the op_allowlist_check macro to remove the assertion or replace it with a runtime check.

The problematic areas were in IListRef_inl.h and DispatchKeyExtractor.h where temporary variables were not properly managed. The fix involved modifying the code to ensure that temporary references do not outlive the objects they reference, preventing the build failure.\nReplace `assert()` with `static_assert()` in `op_allowlist_check` to enforce compile-time checks without invoking non-constexpr functions.\nThe issue was resolved by implementing the fix and confirming regular updates.", "root_cause": "The compilation failure was triggered by changes in the PyTorch repository (commit #129353) and the torch-xpu-ops repository (pull requests #428 and #371).

The problem seems to stem from the interaction between PyTorch's XPU operations and OneDNN's deconvolution primitives, possibly due to incorrect memory configurations or incompatible hardware configurations.

The reporter has provided verbose logs indicating that the failure occurs during the creation of the deconvolution primitive in the forward training phase. The logs show multiple attempts to create and execute the primitive, but it consistently fails, suggesting a deeper issue with the setup or configuration of the OneDNN primitives for deconvolution operations on XPU devices.

The reporter has also enabled fallback mechanisms and slow tests, indicating that the issue is being thoroughly tested but has not yet been resolved. The problem is critical as it affects multiple mathematical and neural network operations, potentially leading to failures in various PyTorch functionalities when using XPU devices.

### Merged Result:227{"issue_number": 227, "issue_description": "UT case <test_comprehensive_nn_functional_nll_loss_xpu_float16> fail because of cpu's nll_loss2d backward.We should try this ut when we implement xpu nll_loss2d op.\nThe issue is an accuracy problem with the nll_loss2d_backward function on XPU. The test test_comprehensive_nn_functional_nll_loss_xpu_float16 failed when using nll_loss2d_backward. The XPU result was 0.04122925, while CUDA and CPU results were 0.04119873, with an atol of 1e-7. The problem arises because the atol for nll_loss2d_backward is too high compared to nll_loss2d_forward, which has an atol of 1e-2. Additionally, using the compile option O0 instead of O3 achieves consistent precision with CUDA, suggesting issues with the XPU compiler's handling of float16 and bfloat16 operations. The root cause appears to be related to optimization bugs in the XPU compiler when processing arithmetic operations on these data types. Attempts to use 'volatile' in the kernel were ineffective. The failure indicates that the decomposed version of nll_loss2d_backward has a higher maximum difference than the original, exceeding the atol threshold.", "reporter": "chunhuanMeng", "assignee": "huaiyuzh", "resolution": "\nThe issue was resolved by adjusting the atol value of nll_loss2d_backward to match that of nll_loss2d_forward.
