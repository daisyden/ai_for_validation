### Merged Result:1246{"issue_number": 1246, "issue_description": "The issue arises during the nightly rolling tests where the 'Run XPU OP UT' stage consistently terminates after approximately 2 hours and 46 minutes. The problem was observed across multiple test runs, with the termination occurring when the test_meta_xpu.py script reached a specific point. The error logs indicate a fatal Python error with a message: 'longjmp causes uninitialized stack frame', leading to the termination of the test suite. The traceback points to issues within the test setup and cleanup processes, particularly related to the management of random number generation and device types in PyTorch's testing framework. The root cause appears to be a resource management issue or a timing problem in the test execution that leads to an uninitialized stack frame, causing the test runner to abort. The resolution involved identifying the problematic test cases and adjusting the test setup to prevent the stack frame from becoming uninitialized, ensuring proper cleanup of resources and synchronization across test threads.\nThe issue involves a test failure during the execution of `test_meta_xpu.py`, specifically the test `test_meta_outplace_nn_functional_adaptive_max_pool3d_xpu_float16`. The error message indicates that the process completed with an exit code 124, which typically signifies a segmentation fault or an abnormal termination.

### Merged Result:585{"issue_number": 585, "issue_description": "Pytorch compilation fail on assertion\nBuild error when using DEBUG=1 and specific compiler flags in a conda environment.\nThe issue involves a compilation error and warnings in the SparseCsrTensor.cpp file. The error stems from a non-constexpr function call during the op_name validation, which is triggered by the use of __assert_fail in the op_allowlist_check macro. The warnings are related to dangling references to temporary objects in the IListRef_inl.h file.\nThe issue involves a build failure when compiling the PyTorch repository, specifically in the file `SparseCsrTensor.cpp`. The error occurs due to a failed assertion during the operation registration, where the operation name `_nnz` does not contain the expected double colon `::`, which is required for certain operations. The warning messages indicate potential issues with dangling references to temporary objects, but these are not the direct cause of the build failure. The root cause is the invalid operation name format in the `TORCH_LIBRARY_IMPL_init_aten_SparseCsrXPU_2` function, leading to the assertion failure. The solution involves correcting the operation name to include the proper namespace separator, ensuring it adheres to the expected format for operation registration in PyTorch.\nThe issue involves a build error when attempting to compile PyTorch with XPU support. The user is encountering a compilation failure in the file `SparseCsrTensor.cpp` with specific warnings about possibly dangling references to temporary variables. The error occurs despite following the PyTorch contribution guide's build instructions. The user has provided the build commands and the resulting error messages, which include detailed compiler output showing the problematic lines in the code. The root cause appears to be related to how temporary variables are being referenced in the code, leading to dangling references during compilation. The issue was successfully closed, indicating that a resolution was found, though the exact fix is not detailed in the provided information.\nThe issue arises due to the use of `assert()` within a `constexpr` function in PyTorch's `op_allowlist_check`. The `assert()` function is not `constexpr`, leading to compilation errors when used in contexts that require compile-time evaluation. The root cause is that `assert()` is a runtime function, and its use violates the constraints of `constexpr` functions, which must be resolvable at compile-time. The solution involves replacing `assert()` with `static_assert()` to ensure the checks are performed at compile-time, thus avoiding runtime function calls. Additionally, ensuring that all operator names passed to `TORCH_SELECTIVE_NAME` follow the required format (e.g., including `::`) resolves the underlying issue. The fix involves modifying the `op_allowlist_check` function to use `static_assert` and updating the operator names in `torch-xpu-ops` to adhere to the correct format. This ensures that the checks are performed statically and the code compiles without errors.\nThis is a github issue link https://github.com/intel/torch-xpu-ops/issues/585.

The test_broadcast() function encounters an error when checking if a tensor is on XPU. There's a missing 'is_xpu' attribute in torch.backends, preventing proper backend checks.

The reporter is DaisyDen and the assignee is also DaisyDen. The issue has been closed. The error occurs during the execution of tests related to the XPU device type.

For example, one error is a RuntimeError due to the 'aten::_copy_from_and_resize' operator not being implemented for the CPU backend. Another error is an AssertionError where tensors are not close, and there are errors related to device type mismatches between CPU and XPU.

The test expected an error about tensors not being on the same device, but instead received a message about the multinomial function expecting a Long tensor but getting a Float. This indicates a type mismatch in tensor output. The error traceback points to the test file where the assertion was made, suggesting that the test expects a specific error message which isn't being met.

The test cases revealed discrepancies between CPU and XPU results for several operations and data types, including complex number handling, bfloat16, and float16 computations. The specific failures include:\n\n1. **tanh function for complex numbers**: The test `test_compare_cpu_tanh_xpu_complex64` failed with an assertion error, showing a 33.3% mismatch in tensor elements. The greatest absolute difference was 2.0, exceeding the allowed tolerance of 0.001.\n2. **bfloat16 operations**: Multiple operations including rsqrt, sub, rounding, cumsum, add, and rsub showed accuracy gaps. For example, `test_compare_cpu_rsqrt_xpu_bfloat16` failed with a 15% mismatch, where the absolute difference was 0.00390625, exceeding the allowed 0.001.\n3. **float16 cumsum**: The test `test_compare_cpu_cumsum_xpu_float16` failed with a 3.2% mismatch, with the absolute difference reaching 0.005859375, beyond the 0.001 tolerance.\n4. **pow, mul, and log operations for complex64**: These operations resulted in NaN values, indicating numerical instability or incorrect computations. The test `test_compare_cpu_pow_xpu_complex64` failed due to this issue.\n\nThe root causes and potential resolutions are under investigation, with some issues linked to underlying Sycl and LLVM/JIRA tickets, suggesting hardware or driver-level optimizations are required. Further analysis and testing are needed to address these discrepancies and improve the accuracy of XPU operations in PyTorch.\nThere are several issues reported in the test cases for the XPU operations in PyTorch. The first issue involves inaccuracies in the fine-grained test, specifically with the `index_put` and `index_add` operations when using boolean values. The test `test_compare_cpu_index_put_xpu_bool` is failing due to a 2.0% mismatch in tensor elements, with the greatest absolute and relative differences being NaN. The second issue occurs when performing division with truncation and rounding on float16 tensors, where the XPU returns 'inf' (infinity) instead of the expected results. The third issue arises when using boolean, integer, or uint8 data types, where the XPU reports that the operation is not implemented, whereas the CPU does not encounter this error. These issues suggest potential bugs in the XPU implementation of these operations, particularly in handling specific data types and edge cases.\nAn issue was reported regarding discrepancies in the output of the `tanh` function on XPU when the input is `-inf+nanj`. The reporter, daisyden, provided test logs and comparisons between XPU and CUDA outputs, indicating that XPU's output does not align with CUDA's expected behavior. The issue was triaged with updates on July 22, 2024, and is currently in an open state. The root cause appears to be related to the implementation of the `tanh` function on XPU, which may not handle complex infinities and NaNs correctly.
