It says that FlexAttention isn't enabled on XPU yet and targets enabling it in torch-2.8. This seems related because both issues involve Torch not being compiled with CUDA enabled, but in this case, it's about XPU support.\n\nThen, issue 957 also has a test failure in `test_linalg_xpu.py` with an AssertionError about Torch not being compiled with CUDA enabled. The reporter mentioned issues in two other GitHub links, which might be related to the same problem. This seems very similar to the current issue because it's the same test file and the same error message.\n\nIssue 956 is about an outdated torch-xpu-ops version causing test cases to be skipped. The root cause was that the version used didn't enable certain features, leading to backward compatibility issues. This could also be a factor if the current test is using an older version that lacks necessary support.\n\nI should compare the current issue with these. The error message is the same as in issues 1521 and 957. Issue 1521 is about FlexAttention not being enabled on XPU, which might not directly relate to the linalg test. However, issue 957 is about the same test file failing with the same error, so that's a closer match.\n\nThe root cause in issue 957 was related to the torch-xpu-ops version being outdated, which caused backward compatibility issues. The current issue might have a similar underlying problem, such as missing XPU support or outdated dependencies.\n\nSo, the similar issue is likely 957, which is closed. The current issue's description should mention the failed test and the error, with the root cause possibly being outdated or missing XPU support. The suggested owner would be the maintainer of torch-xpu-ops, like penghui_cheng.

It says that the module `torch._C` doesn't have an attribute `_cuda_tunableop_enable`. That suggests that the code is trying to access a function or variable from PyTorch's C extensions that doesn't exist. Maybe this attribute was removed or renamed in a newer version of PyTorch.\n\nLooking at the search results provided, I see a few issues related to XPU devices and Torch. Issue 221 mentions enabling XPU support and a `RuntimeError` about the device type not being supported. Issue 128 has several test failures related to dropout and other functions, pointing to issues in `torch-xpu-ops`. Issue 494 is about an `NotImplementedError` for a specific operator on XPU.\n\nThe current issue is about a test failing because it can't find `_cuda_tunableop_enable` in `torch._C`. Since the test is in `test_linalg_xpu`, it's related to linear algebra operations on XPU. The error suggests that the test is trying to use a CUDA-specific feature on an XPU device, which might not be supported.\n\nI notice that in Issue 128, there are multiple test failures linked to `torch-xpu-ops` issues, particularly #157, which seems to be a common root cause. Maybe the same underlying problem is affecting this test. The error in Issue 128 mentions \"masked_scale\" not being implemented, which is different, but the pattern of multiple tests failing due to missing implementations in `torch-xpu-ops` is similar.\n\nAnother thought: the test is trying to use a tunable operator, which might be a feature that's only implemented for CUDA and not for XPU. If the XPU implementation of these operators isn't complete, the test would fail when it tries to access them.\n\nLooking at the root causes, Issue 494 points to an operator not being implemented for XPU. So, it's possible that `_cuda_tunableop_enable` is part of a CUDA-specific implementation that hasn't been properly ported to XPU. The test might be assuming that this attribute exists and works the same way on XPU as it does on CUDA, which isn't the case.\n\nThe solution might involve checking if the test should run on XPU at all. If the tunable operators aren't supported on XPU, the test should be skipped. Alternatively, there might be a missing implementation in `torch-xpu-ops` that needs to be added to support this functionality.\n\nI should also consider if there are any recent changes in PyTorch that might have removed or renamed this attribute. If the test was written for an older version of PyTorch, it might need to be updated to use the current API.\n\nIn summary, the issue is likely due to the test attempting to use a CUDA-specific feature on XPU, which isn't implemented. The solution would involve either skipping the test for XPU or implementing the necessary support in `torch-xpu-ops`.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": \"N/A\",\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"N/A\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"fengyuan14\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"Unit test third_party.torch-xpu-ops.test.xpu.test_linalg_xpu.TestLinalgXPU test_gemm_bias_tunableop_xpu_bfloat16 failed with AttributeError: module 'torch._C' has no attribute '_cuda_tunableop_enable'.

It says Torch isn't compiled with CUDA enabled. That makes me think that somewhere in the code, it's trying to use CUDA functionality, but Torch wasn't built with CUDA support. But wait, the test is for XPU, not CUDA. So why is it complaining about CUDA?\n\nLooking at the search results, there are a few similar issues. The first one is issue 1521, where PyTorch's Flex Attention failed on XPU with the same error. The root cause was that FlexAttention wasn't enabled on XPU yet. The second issue, 1196, was about skipping CUDA tests because XPU didn't support FP8. The third issue, 221, was about enabling mode for XPU but the mode only supported CPU and CUDA.\n\nHmm, so in the current issue, the test is for XPU, but it's throwing a CUDA error. Maybe the test is mistakenly trying to use CUDA code when it should be using XPU. Or perhaps there's a dependency on CUDA that's not properly handled when running on XPU.\n\nLooking at issue 1196, they had to skip CUDA tests because XPU didn't support certain features. Maybe in this case, the test is trying to run something that requires CUDA, which isn't available. Alternatively, maybe the test setup is incorrectly assuming CUDA is enabled when it shouldn't be.\n\nAnother angle: could the test be using some CUDA-specific code paths that aren't properly handled on XPU? Or perhaps the environment isn't set up correctly, so when the test runs, it's trying to access CUDA even though it's supposed to be using XPU.\n\nI should also consider if the test is correctly patched or if there's a missing patch that would allow it to run on XPU without relying on CUDA. In issue 221, they had to patch some imports to run tests on XPU, so maybe a similar approach is needed here.\n\nSo, putting this together, the issue might be that the test is either trying to use CUDA functions that aren't available on XPU or there's a missing patch that allows the test to run correctly on XPU. The root cause could be similar to issue 1196, where certain tests need to be skipped because the hardware doesn't support them, or it might be a case where the test isn't properly adapted for XPU, leading it to rely on CUDA.\n\nI think the best approach is to check if the test can be modified to skip CUDA-specific code when running on XPU or to ensure that all CUDA dependencies are properly handled.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that PyTorch uses XPU for acceleration, which is Intel's technology. The error message suggests that there's an issue with the CUDA-related code, but since we're using XPU, maybe something is trying to access CUDA-specific features that aren't properly set up for XPU.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see a few related issues. Issue 1521 mentions that PyTorch's Flex Attention fails on XPU because it's not enabled yet. The reporter is githubsgi, and the assignee is liangan1. The state is open, and they're targeting enabling it in torch-2.8. This seems related because it's about XPU support for a specific feature.\n\nThen there's issue 221, which is about enabling mode supports XPU device and getting a RuntimeError because the mode only supports CPU and CUDA, not XPU. The reporter is PenghuiCheng, and the assignee is daisyden. This is closed, but it shows that there have been issues with XPU compatibility before.\n\nIssue 128 has multiple test failures related to IPEX and torch-xpu-ops, with some pointing to issues on the torch-xpu-ops repository. The reporter is fengyuan14, and the assignee is ZhiweiYan-96. It's closed, but the root cause seems to be differences between IPEX and torch-xpu-ops.\n\nNow, the current issue is about `test_scaled_gemm_tunableop_xpu_float8_e5m2fnuz` failing with an AttributeError related to `_cuda_tunableop_enable`. The error suggests that the code is trying to access a CUDA-specific attribute that doesn't exist when running on XPU. This makes me think that the code isn't properly handling the XPU backend, perhaps assuming CUDA is available.\n\nI remember that in PyTorch, some operations are implemented differently for CUDA and XPU. If the test is trying to use a CUDA-specific feature without checking for XPU support, it would throw such an error. Maybe the `scaled_gemm_tunableop` isn't properly implemented or registered for XPU, leading to it trying to fall back to a CUDA-only implementation.\n\nLooking at the search results, issue 1521 is still open and targets enabling Flex Attention on XPU in a future release. This suggests that there are ongoing efforts to improve XPU support, but certain features aren't ready yet. The current issue might be hitting a similar wall where a specific operation isn't supported on XPU, causing the test to fail.\n\nThe root cause here is likely that the `scaled_gemm_tunableop` isn't properly implemented or registered for XPU, leading to it trying to access CUDA-specific code paths that aren't available. The solution would involve implementing or enabling this operation for XPU, possibly by updating the PyTorch codebase to handle XPU in this context.\n\nI should suggest that the owner of the issue, perhaps someone from the PyTorch team working on XPU support, looks into implementing `scaled_gemm_tunableop` for XPU. They might need to create a PR similar to the one mentioned in issue 1521, targeting a future release of PyTorch where this feature is enabled for XPU.\n\nIn summary, the issue is due to missing XPU support for `scaled_gemm_tunableop`, and the solution involves implementing this support in PyTorch, likely in a future release after the necessary code changes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": 1521,\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"open\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"githubsgi\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"The unit test `test_scaled_gemm_tunableop_xpu_float8_e5m2fnuz` is failing due to an `AttributeError` indicating that the CUDA-specific attribute `_cuda_tunableop_enable` is being accessed on XPU.

The error message is a `RuntimeError` saying \"output 1: meta disagrees with real impl\".\n\nLooking at the search results, I see several issues. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, issue 1432 has a similar error message about \"meta disagrees with real impl\" related to scaled dot product attention.

The test that failed is `test_transformerencoder_fastpath_use_torchscript_False_enable_nested_tensor_False_use_autocast_True_d_model_12_xpu` in `third_party.torch-xpu-ops.test.xpu.test_transformers_xpu.TestTransformersXPU`. The error message is a `RuntimeError` about \"output 1: meta disagrees with real impl\".\n\nLooking at the search results, there are a few issues listed. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, issue 1432 has a similar error message: `RuntimeError: output 1: meta disagrees with real impl: ...`. The description mentions that SDPA cases failed after enabling XPU in PyTorch. The error seems related to the meta tensor's shape not matching the real tensor's shape. The root cause was NaN outputs for fully masked rows. The state is \"open\", so it's still being worked on.\n\nNext, issue 1431 is a different error about `to_padded_tensor` and has no direct relation to the current test failure.\n\nIssue 645 is about multiple test failures, but the specific error message doesn't match the current one. It's related to MTL and some test cases passing on other environments, but it's closed now.\n\nSo, the current test failure's error message is very similar to issue 1432. Both involve a meta tensor shape mismatch, which suggests they might be related. The root cause in 1432 was NaN outputs in certain rows, which could be causing the transformer encoder to fail when using XPU.\n\nI should check if the transformer encoder uses the same attention mechanisms that might be affected by this. If the attention layers are involved, enabling XPU might have introduced this NaN issue, leading to the meta tensor mismatch.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that this is a known issue (1432) that's still open. The root cause is probably the same: NaN outputs when certain conditions are met, like fully masked rows, which might be happening in the transformer test case.\n\nThe suggested owner would be the same as in issue 1432, which is LuFinch. The solution might involve fixing the attention mechanism to handle these cases without producing NaNs, possibly by adding checks or initializing values properly.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that this test failure is a known issue, and the relevant information should be structured accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": 1432,\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"open\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"The failed unit test involves a RuntimeError related to a meta tensor shape mismatch in the transformer encoder when using XPU.

The test that failed is `test_dispatch_meta_outplace_norm_fro_xpu_complex128` and it's returning a `RuntimeError: output 0: meta disagrees with real impl.` \n\nLooking at the search results provided, I see several issues with similar error messages. The first one is issue 1432, which also has a RuntimeError related to meta and real impl disagreement, specifically with `scaled_dot_product_fused_attention_overrideable.default`. The error message mentions that the expected shape was `[4,4,3]` but the real shape was empty. The root cause was NaN outputs for fully masked rows.\n\nAnother relevant issue is 1569, which has a similar structure in the error message, mentioning `output 0: meta disagrees with real impl` for the `norm.ScalarOpt_dim` operation. The shape mismatch here is between `[5,5]` and `[]`. This seems related because both involve shape discrepancies between expected and actual outputs.\n\nIssue 1431 also has a RuntimeError but it's about `to_padded_tensor`, which is a different function, so maybe not as relevant. Issues 1581 and others are about segmentation faults or other test failures, so they don't seem directly related.\n\nThe current issue's error is about `norm` operation, specifically `outplace_norm_fro_xpu_complex128`. The fact that it's a norm operation and involves a shape mismatch suggests it's related to how tensors are being handled during normalization on the XPU.

The error message is an `AssertionError: Tensor-likes are not close!`, which suggests that the tensors being compared aren't matching as expected. \n\nLooking at the search results provided, I see a few issues that might be related. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, issue 669 is about a test failure in `test_module_xpu.py` involving `ConvTranspose3d`. The error message mentions tensor-like mismatch, which is similar to the current issue. The root cause wasn't clear, but the resolution was to skip the test and adjust tolerance. This seems somewhat related because it's a test failure due to tensor mismatch, but it's a different test and operation.\n\nNext, issue 676 is about `TestMatmulCudaXPU` failing with a similar tensor error. The resolution here was that it passed with the latest code, which might indicate that the issue was fixed over time. However, this is a different test case, so it's not directly related but shows that such issues can be resolved.\n\nThen, issue 1400 is about `test_rms_norm.py` failing with the same assertion error. The description is incomplete, but it's another test failure related to tensor comparison. Again, the test name is different, so it's not directly related but shows a pattern of such errors.\n\nNow, considering the current issue, it's testing the `cosh` function on XPU with complex128 tensors. The failure is due to tensor values not matching between CPU and XPU. I need to see if there's a known issue related to `cosh` or complex128 tensors in XPU operations.\n\nLooking back, none of the provided issues directly mention `cosh` or complex128 tensors. Issue 669 was about `ConvTranspose3d`, 676 about `Matmul`, and 1400 about `RMSNorm`. So, there's no exact match here.\n\nHowever, the fact that multiple tests are failing with similar tensor mismatch errors suggests that there might be a broader issue with how certain operations are handled on XPU, especially with specific data types like complex128. It could be related to numerical precision differences between CPU and XPU implementations, especially for complex numbers, which can be more sensitive to precision changes.\n\nAnother angle is that the `cosh` function might have a different implementation on XPU compared to CPU, leading to slight discrepancies in the results. These discrepancies might be within acceptable limits for some operations but cause failures when using complex128, which might have stricter tolerance requirements.\n\nGiven that, the likely root cause could be a precision mismatch or an implementation difference in the `cosh` function on XPU. The solution might involve adjusting the tolerance levels for the test or improving the XPU implementation of `cosh` to better match the CPU results.\n\nSince there's no exact known issue, I'll have to propose that this might be a new issue, but it's related to previous tensor mismatch problems. The owner could be the same as in similar issues, perhaps `daisyden`, who handled the previous cases.\n\nIn summary, while there's no direct match, the pattern suggests that this is a known type of issue, and the approach to solving it would involve checking the implementation of `cosh` on XPU, adjusting tolerances, or both.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": \"N/A\",\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"N/A\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"daisyden\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"The test `test_ops_xpu.py::TestCommonXPU::test_compare_cpu_cosh_xpu_complex128` failed with an `AssertionError: Tensor-likes are not close!` error, indicating a mismatch between CPU and XPU tensor results for the `cosh` function with complex128 tensors.\",\n  \"root_causes\": [\n    \"Numerical precision differences between CPU and XPU implementations of the `cosh` function for complex128 tensors.\",\n    \"Implementation discrepancies in the `cosh` operation on XPU leading to results that do not match CPU computations within acceptable tolerances.\"\n  ],\n  \"suggested_solutions\": [\n    \"Adjust the tolerance levels in the test to accommodate minor numerical differences.\",\n    \"Review and potentially update the XPU implementation of the `cosh` function to align more closely with CPU results, especially for complex128 tensors.\"\n  ]\n}\n```","audio":null},"finish_reason":"stop","metadata":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0}}

Let me start by looking at the information provided.\n\nFirst, the user provided three search results from their knowledge base. Each result is a JSON object with details about an issue. I'll go through each one to see if any are similar to the current problem.\n\nThe first result is issue 1236. The description mentions a test failure in `test_max_pool_nan_inf_xpu_float64` with a RuntimeError related to the Native API returning an error code. The error message is about `math.isinf(res2.item())` failing. The state is closed, and the resolution mentions testing in a specific environment. The root cause isn't detailed, but the issue was resolved by testing in a certain setup.\n\nThe second result is issue 233. It involves multiple test cases failing with errors about unsupported operations related to tensors and cloning. The error messages mention issues with written-to tensors referring to single memory locations. This seems more about tensor operations and memory management, which is a different kind of issue than the current one, which is about pooling and a specific UR error.\n\nThe third result is issue 771. It lists several test failures in `nn/test_pooling_xpu.py`, including `test_max_pool_nan_inf_xpu_float16` and others. The state is closed, and the resolution says the cases passed in the main branch. Again, the root cause isn't specified, but it's related to pooling tests.\n\nNow, the current issue is about `test_maxpool3d_non_square_backward_xpu` failing with a RuntimeError: UR error. The UR error code 2147483646 is the same as in issue 1236. Both issues are in the same test file and involve similar functions (`test_max_pool_nan_inf` vs `test_maxpool3d_non_square_backward`). The error type is also the same, pointing to a Native API issue.\n\nLooking at the other issues, issue 233 is about tensor operations and isn't related. Issue 771 is about multiple pooling tests but doesn't mention the specific UR error or the 3D maxpool.\n\nSo, the most similar issue is 1236. Both involve the same type of error in pooling tests. The root cause might be related to how the pooling operations handle certain data types or edge cases, leading to the UR error. The solution in issue 1236 involved testing in a specific environment, which suggests that the issue might be resolved by updating dependencies or testing in a compatible setup.\n\nTherefore, the current issue is similar to issue 1236. The state of issue 1236 is closed, so the current issue might be a duplicate or related but not yet resolved. The owner should be the same as in issue 1236, likely Stonepia. The root cause is probably a bug in the pooling operation handling, and the solution would involve testing and resolving the underlying issue causing the UR error.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": 1236,\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"closed\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"Stonepia\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"The test `nn\\\\test_pooling_xpu.py::TestPoolingNNDeviceTypeXPU::test_maxpool3d_non_square_backward_xpu` failed with a RuntimeError: UR error.

The error message is an `AssertionError: Tensor-likes are not close!`, which suggests that the tensors being compared aren't matching as expected. \n\nLooking at the search results provided, I see a few issues that might be related. The first one is issue 594, which also has an `AssertionError: Tensor-likes are not close!` and mentions inconsistencies between Numpy and XPU results, especially with extreme values and complex numbers. That seems very similar to the current issue because both involve tensor mismatches and complex operations.\n\nAnother issue, number 669, also has a similar error message related to ConvTranspose3d operations, but it's closed and the root cause isn't clearly stated.

The root cause in 594 was due to differences in how standard operations handle complex numbers on XPU compared to Numpy. So, the same problem might be causing the current test failure.\n\nThe reporter for issue 594 was `yuchengliu1`, who also assigned it to themselves.

Let me start by understanding what this error means.\n\nI know that PyTorch uses Ninja as a build system, especially for compiling C++ extensions. So, when this error pops up, it probably means that the environment doesn't have Ninja installed or it's not properly configured. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's an issue mentioned in the PyTorch repository (issue 618) where similar problems were encountered. The user there was dealing with multiple test failures, including some related to autograd and XPU operations. The issue was closed, which suggests it was resolved, but the details are a bit sparse.\n\nI also see that there's a link to another GitHub issue (issue 910) related to `torch-xpu-ops`. That issue was closed and assigned to someone named min-jean-cho. The problem there was about the `fp64` aspect not being supported, but the solution might involve installing dependencies or checking the environment setup.\n\nSo, putting this together, the current issue is about a missing dependency—Ninja. The solution likely involves installing Ninja. I should check if the user has Ninja installed. If not, installing it via `pip install ninja` or another package manager might fix the problem. Alternatively, maybe the environment variables aren't set up correctly, so ensuring that Ninja is in the PATH could help.\n\nI should also consider if there are any platform-specific issues. For example, on Windows, Ninja might require certain build tools. But since the error is generic, it's probably a simple installation issue.\n\nIn summary, the main steps would be: check if Ninja is installed, install it if not, and ensure it's properly configured in the environment.

It says that the `_thnn_fused_lstm_cell` operator isn't implemented for the CPU backend. That's a bit confusing because the test is supposed to be running on XPU, right? So why is it falling back to CPU?\n\nLooking at the search results, I see that issue #1231 mentions a similar problem with the LSTM operator not being supported on XPU. The solution there was to implement it in `torch-xpu-ops` and set an environment variable for fallback. But in this case, the error is about the CPU backend, not XPU. Maybe the test is mistakenly using CPU instead of XPU, or there's a fallback issue.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that issue #231 had a `NotImplementedError` for XPU, which was fixed by updating the test to handle XPU properly. So maybe the same approach is needed here—ensuring the test correctly handles XPU and doesn't fall back to CPU.\n\nI should also consider if the test is correctly set up to use XPU. If it's not, it might default to CPU, causing the error. Checking the test setup would be important. Additionally, maybe the `_thnn_fused_lstm_cell` operator isn't implemented on XPU yet, so the fallback to CPU is causing the test to fail.\n\nSo, the possible root causes are either the test isn't properly using XPU, or the LSTM cell isn't implemented for XPU, forcing a CPU fallback. The solution might involve updating the test to ensure it runs on XPU and possibly implementing the LSTM operator for XPU if it's not already done.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": 1231,\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"closed\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"mengfei25\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"The test case is failing due to a NotImplementedError when trying to run the 'aten::_thnn_fused_lstm_cell' operator on the CPU backend, which suggests that the operator is not implemented for the XPU device.

The user provided some search results from their knowledge base, so I'll start by looking through those to see if any similar issues have been reported before.\n\nLooking at the merged results, I see three issues: 669, 676, and 1401. Let me go through each one.\n\nIssue 669 is about a test failure in `test_module_xpu.py` related to `ConvTranspose3d` with non-contiguous tensors. The error message mentions tensors not being close, which is similar to the current issue. The root cause wasn't clear, but it was closed after skipping the test and adjusting tolerance. So, this seems somewhat related but not exactly the same since it's a different test and operation.\n\nIssue 676 is about `TestMatmulCudaXPU` failing with a similar tensor closeness error. The test involves matrix multiplication, which is a different operation altogether. The resolution mentions it passed with the latest code, but again, the root cause isn't detailed here. This doesn't seem directly related to the current issue.\n\nIssue 1401 is about `test_weight_norm.py` failing with an assertion error on tensor closeness. The test involves weight normalization and gradients. The error occurs when comparing gradients on CPU and XPU. This is a different test and functionality, so probably not related to the current issue.\n\nNow, the current issue is about `test_unary_ufuncs_xpu.py` failing for `acos` with complex32 tensors. The error is about tensor-like values not being close, which is a common theme in these issues. However, the specific test and function are different each time.\n\nI don't see any issues that exactly match the current test case. The functions involved (ConvTranspose3d, Matmul, weight norm, and now acos) are all different, so the root causes are likely distinct. The only similarity is the type of error message, which is common in numerical tests.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that this specific test failure isn't a known issue based on the provided results.

The error message is an `AssertionError: Tensor-likes are not close!`, which I've seen before in other issues. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are a few similar issues. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, issue 669 is about a test failure in `test_module_xpu.py` related to `ConvTranspose3d`. The error message is similar, mentioning tensor-like mismatch. The state is closed, and the resolution was to skip the test and adjust tolerance. The root cause wasn't clear, but it involved non-contiguous tensors and ConvTranspose3d.\n\nNext, issue 676 is about `TestMatmulCudaXPU` failing with a tensor mismatch. The error message is the same, and it's also closed. The resolution was that it passed with the latest code, but there's no root cause mentioned.\n\nThen, issue 1401 is about `test_weight_norm.py` failing with tensor mismatch. The test compares gradients on CPU and XPU, and the error is in the gradient's grad. The issue is still open, but the reporter is working on it.\n\nThe current issue is about `test_compare_cpu_nn_functional_softshrink_xpu_bfloat16`. The test compares the output of a CPU and XPU Softshrink operation using bfloat16. The error is a tensor mismatch, which is similar to the previous issues.\n\nI notice that all these issues involve tensor mismatches between CPU and XPU, which suggests it's a common problem. The root causes might be related to numerical precision differences, especially since this test uses bfloat16. Bfloat16 has lower precision than float32, so small discrepancies might be more noticeable.\n\nLooking at the solutions from the past, issue 669 was resolved by skipping the test and adjusting tolerance. Issue 676 passed with the latest code, so maybe a code change fixed it.

Native API returns: -36 (PI_ERROR_INVALID_QUEUE)\" is a known issue. Let me start by looking at the search results provided.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each merged result one by one to see if any of them have similar issues.\n\nLooking at issue 745, the description mentions \"PI_ERROR_INVALID_QUEUE\" after copying a tensor from device 0 to device 1. The error occurs when trying to print the tensor. The state is closed, and the root cause is related to launching a kernel on PVC Tile 1. This seems very similar to the current issue because both involve the same error code and tensor operations between devices.\n\nNext, issue 737 doesn't have much detail. The reporter and assignee are different, but the description doesn't mention any specific error related to the one we're looking for. So, I can probably skip this one.\n\nIssue 1113 involves a different error code, UR_RESULT_ERROR_UNINITIALIZED, which is 37. Since our current issue is about -36, this isn't a match. Plus, it's related to nightly wheels, which might not be the same context as our problem.\n\nIssue 910 lists several runtime errors, including some about FP64 and other devices. One of the errors mentioned is \"Native API failed. Native API returns: -999 (Unknown PI error)\", but that's a different code. So, this doesn't seem related to our specific -36 error.\n\nPutting this together, issue 745 is the only one that matches the error code and context. Both involve moving tensors between devices and encountering PI_ERROR_INVALID_QUEUE. The fact that it's closed suggests that a fix was found, which could be helpful for resolving the current issue.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the current issue is similar to issue 745. The state of that issue is closed, so the problem might have been resolved before. The root cause was related to kernel launch issues on a specific tile, and the solution involved handling cases with multiple devices, like client platforms with integrated and discrete GPUs.\n\nI should structure the answer to include the similar issue ID, its state, and provide details about the issue description, root cause, and solution based on issue 745.

The greatest absolute difference is about 0.000052785, and the relative difference is 0.0000021018. \n\nLooking at the search results provided, I see a few issues that might be related. The first one is issue 669, which also involves a test failure in test_non_contiguous_tensors_nn_ConvTranspose3d_xpu_float32. The error message is similar, mentioning tensors not being close. The root cause wasn't clear, but the issue was closed after skipping the test and adjusting tolerance. \n\nAnother issue is 676, which is about a matmul test failing with tensor closeness issues. It was resolved with the latest code. Then there's issue 594, which deals with inconsistencies between Numpy and XPU for extreme values, but that's more about std operations on complex numbers, which doesn't seem directly related.\n\nThe current issue is about LazyConv3d, which is a different layer than ConvTranspose3d, but both are part of the non-contiguous tensors tests. The high mismatch percentage suggests a deeper issue with how the tensors are handled in these modules. \n\nI should consider if this is a known issue. Since issue 669 is similar and was closed, maybe this is a duplicate or a related problem. The root cause in 669 wasn't clear, but the approach taken was to skip the test and adjust tolerance. For the current issue, the high mismatch might indicate a problem with how the LazyConv3d layer handles non-contiguous tensors, possibly due to how the data is being processed or the way the layer is implemented on XPU.\n\nThe owner should probably be the same as in 669, which was daisyden. The issue description should mention the specific test failure and the high mismatch rate. The root cause might be related to how non-contiguous tensors are handled in LazyConv3d, perhaps in the data layout or how the layer processes the input. The solution could involve adjusting the tolerance levels, similar to what was done in 669, or fixing the underlying issue in the LazyConv3d implementation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the issue is similar to 669, both being test failures in non-contiguous tensor handling for different NN layers.

The test is called test_tensordot_out_kernel_errors_with_autograd_xpu_float32 and it's in the torch-xpu-ops.test.xpu.test_linalg_xpu module. The error message says there's an AssertionError because the message \"the 'out' tensor was specified and requires gradients\" doesn't match \"cannot resize variables that require grad\". \n\nHmm, I remember that in PyTorch, when you use autograd, tensors that require gradients can't be resized in certain ways because that would mess up the computation graph. So, the error is probably happening because somewhere in the code, we're trying to resize a tensor that's supposed to keep its gradients.\n\nLooking at the test code, it's using the xpu device, which is Intel's oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) runtime. So, the issue might be related to how operations on the XPU handle tensors that require gradients.\n\nI should check if there are similar issues reported before. From the search results, I see a few issues. For example, issue 1550 mentions that the 'aten::_scaled_mm.out' operator isn't implemented for XPU, causing test failures. That's about a missing operation, but our issue is about an assertion error during autograd.\n\nAnother issue, 1549, is an AssertionError about 'fused_all_gather_scaled_matmul' not being found. It seems related to distributed tensor operations, which might not be directly connected to our problem.\n\nIssue 618 talks about some autograd tests failing with various errors, including an AttributeError about 'torch.xpu' not having an attribute. That's a bit closer because it's about autograd and XPU, but the specific error messages don't match exactly.\n\nWait, the current issue's error is about the 'out' tensor requiring gradients. I recall that in PyTorch, when you pass an 'out' tensor to an operation, it's expected to be a leaf variable. If it's not, you might get an error when trying to compute gradients because the autograd can't handle non-leaf variables in certain operations.\n\nSo, maybe the test is trying to perform a tensordot operation with an 'out' tensor that's supposed to require gradients, but the XPU implementation isn't handling this correctly. The error message suggests that the operation is trying to resize a tensor that requires gradients, which isn't allowed.\n\nI should look into how the tensordot operation is implemented on XPU. If the XPU backend doesn't properly handle cases where the 'out' tensor requires gradients, that could cause this error. Maybe the kernel isn't designed to handle autograd's requirements for such tensors.\n\nAnother angle is that the test might be expecting a certain behavior when using the 'out' parameter, but the XPU implementation isn't adhering to that. For example, if the kernel doesn't correctly mark the tensor as not requiring gradients or if it's not a leaf variable, autograd might throw an error.\n\nI should also consider if there are any recent changes in the XPU backend or in PyTorch's autograd that could have introduced this issue. Maybe a recent update broke compatibility with how the 'out' tensor is handled during operations on XPU.\n\nTo fix this, perhaps the kernel needs to be modified to ensure that when the 'out' tensor requires gradients, it's handled properly without resizing. Alternatively, the test might need to be adjusted to not use the 'out' parameter when autograd is active, but that seems less likely.\n\nI should also check if there are any known issues in the torch-xpu-ops repository related to autograd and tensordot operations. If similar issues have been reported before, the solution might involve updating the kernel to respect the autograd requirements or adjusting how the 'out' tensor is managed.\n\nIn summary, the issue seems to stem from the interaction between the XPU backend's tensordot operation and PyTorch's autograd system when using an 'out' tensor that requires gradients. The solution likely involves modifying the XPU kernel to handle such cases correctly or adjusting the test to avoid the problematic scenario.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": \"N/A\",\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"N/A\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"PenghuiCheng\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"AssertionError: 'the 'out' tensor was specified and requires gradients' does not match 'cannot resize variables that require grad' in test_tensordot_out_kernel_errors_with_autograd_xpu_float32.\",\n  \"root_cause\": \"The test fails due to an assertion error when using the 'out' tensor with autograd on XPU.

The error message says `NotImplementedError: Could not run 'aten::_conv_depthwise2d' with arguments from the 'CPU' backend.` Hmm, that's a bit confusing because I thought the test was supposed to run on XPU.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the error details. It mentions that the operator `aten::_conv_depthwise2d` isn't available for the CPU backend. But wait, the test is for XPU, so why is it trying to use the CPU backend? Maybe there's a configuration issue where the test isn't properly set up to use XPU resources.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see a few similar issues. For example, issue 1532 was about `torchvision::deform_conv2d` not being implemented for XPU, and it was resolved by using a specific PyTorch version. Another issue, 715, had problems with the MOCO model not supporting XPU. These seem related to operators not being available on XPU, which is similar to what I'm seeing here.\n\nIn the current issue, the error is about `_conv_depthwise2d` not being available on CPU. But since the test is for XPU, maybe the test setup is incorrectly using CPU instead of XPU. Or perhaps the operator isn't properly registered for XPU, causing it to fall back to CPU, which doesn't support it.\n\nI should check if the test is correctly configured to run on XPU. If it's mistakenly using CPU resources, that would cause this error. Alternatively, maybe the operator `_conv_depthwise2d` isn't implemented for XPU, so when the test runs, it's trying to use an unavailable backend.\n\nLooking at the root causes from previous issues, it seems that missing operator implementations or incorrect backend configurations are common problems. So, for this issue, the root cause might be that `_conv_depthwise2d` isn't implemented for XPU, or the test isn't using XPU as intended.\n\nTo fix this, I should suggest verifying that the test is using XPU resources correctly. If the operator isn't implemented, the team might need to add support for it in the XPU backend. Alternatively, if it's a configuration error, adjusting the test setup to use XPU properly should resolve the issue.\n\nI think the owner should be someone from the PyTorch/XPU team, maybe the person who handles the `torch-xpu-ops` repository.

The user provided some search results from their knowledge base, so I'll start by looking through those to see if any similar issues are mentioned.\n\nLooking at the first result, issue 227, it's about a test failure in `test_comprehensive_nn_functional_nll_loss_xpu_float16`. The problem was with the `nll_loss2d_backward` function on CPU not matching XPU results. They mentioned an accuracy issue where the absolute tolerance (atol) was too high. The solution involved adjusting the atol and possibly compiler optimizations. This seems related because both issues involve `nll_loss` functions and discrepancies between CPU and XPU results, especially with float types.\n\nThe second result, issue 686, talks about UT failures with `nanmean` and other functions, but the description is a bit unclear. It mentions a test failure with a large absolute difference and a GitHub link, but it doesn't seem directly related to the `cross_entropy` function or decomposition issues. So, maybe not as relevant.\n\nThe third result, issue 233, involves multiple test failures related to unsupported operations with tensors, specifically about cloning tensors or memory copy issues. This doesn't seem directly connected to the `cross_entropy` test failure, which is about decomposition differences.\n\nNow, the current issue is about a decomposition test failing because the difference between the original and decomposed `nll_loss_backward` is too large. The original max diff is 0, but the decomposed version has a max diff of 0.4765625. This seems similar to issue 227, where the issue was about the backward pass of `nll_loss2d` not matching between CPU and XPU. Both involve discrepancies in the backward pass of loss functions on different hardware.\n\nSo, I think issue 227 is a similar problem. The root cause in issue 227 was a bug in the CPU's `nll_loss2d_backward` function not being compatible with XPU. The solution was to adjust the atol and possibly compiler optimizations.

  "issue_description": "Test `test_comprehensive_nn_functional_cross_entropy_xpu_bfloat16` failed due to a decomposition issue in `nll_loss_backward.default`. The decomposition resulted in a larger difference (0.4765625) compared to the original implementation (0.0), indicating a potential bug in the decomposed version's backward pass on XPU.",
  "root_cause": "The decomposition of `nll_loss_backward.default` on XPU introduces inaccuracies, likely due to a bug in the decomposed implementation's backward pass, leading to a significant difference from the original implementation.",
  "solution": "Adjust the absolute tolerance (atol) for the decomposition test to accommodate the observed difference. Investigate and optimize the decomposed kernel to ensure compatibility and accuracy between the decomposition and the original implementation."
