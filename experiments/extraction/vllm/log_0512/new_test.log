Let me start by looking at the information provided.\n\nFirst, I see that there are three search results provided. Let me go through each one to see if they relate to the issue I'm looking at.\n\nThe first search result is issue 1636. It mentions three FSDP test cases failing with errors like \"AssertionError: Tensor-likes are not close!\" and \"Scalars are not equal!\". The tests that failed include `test_transformer_backend_inductor_fullgraph_True`, `test_fp16_hook_has_wrapping_False_sharding_strategy0`, and `test_fsdp_compile`. The error messages are similar to what I'm seeing, so this seems related. The issue is still open, so maybe it's the same problem.\n\nThe second search result is issue 222. It's about failures in `test_reductions_xpu.py` with errors like \"AssertionError: Scalars are not close!\" and others. It mentions issues with XPU devices and how NaN and INF are handled. The issue is closed, but it's about XPU tests, which might be related since the test in question is `test_hooks_multi_traversal_xpu`. However, the root cause here was different, involving handling of special values and missing kernels.\n\nThe third search result is issue 1504, which talks about accuracy gaps in FSDP tests on XELink hardware. It lists several failed tests, including `test_hooks_multi_traversal_xpu`, and mentions issues with scalar and tensor comparisons. The error messages here include differences in expected and actual values, similar to what I'm seeing. The issue is open, and the assignee is the same as in issue 1636.\n\nSo, the test that failed is `test_hooks_multi_traversal_xpu`, which is mentioned in both issues 1504 and 1636. The error message is about scalars not being close, which matches the problem I'm looking at. \n\nLooking at the root causes, issue 1504 suggests possible synchronization issues, data type mismatches, or incorrect gradient accumulation. Issue 1636 points to problems during compilation and execution, specifically in `run_and_get_code` and `aot_autograd` functions.\n\nThe assignee for both issues is `zhangxiaoli73`, so that's likely the owner to assign the current issue to.\n\nPutting this together, the failed test is part of known issues, specifically issue 1504, which is still open. The root causes point towards FSDP implementation issues on specific hardware, possibly related to data handling during training or synchronization. The suggested solutions would involve reviewing the FSDP implementation, checking for data type mismatches, and ensuring proper synchronization across devices, especially on XELink hardware.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": 1504,\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"open\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"zhangxiaoli73\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"Accuracy gaps in FSDP tests on XELink hardware were reported.

The only difference is the specific test method name, but it's still within the same test file. The root cause is likely the same, pointing towards communication issues in CCL, maybe due to environment setup or configuration problems.\n\nI should check if there are any known issues with the current setup, like environment variables not being set correctly or conflicts with other libraries. Maybe the MPI or oneCCL configurations are causing the processes to hang or fail during communication. Also, considering the test environment, if it's running on a different machine or with different hardware, that might affect how CCL is behaving.\n\nTo resolve this, I should look into the CCL and MPI configurations. Ensuring that all necessary environment variables are set properly and that there are no conflicts with other libraries might help. Additionally, checking if the latest versions of oneCCL and PyTorch are compatible and up-to-date could resolve the issue.

This happens in the `_join_processes(fn)` function during mixed precision testing on XPU.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see a few relevant issues. The first one is issue #1475, which has almost the exact same description. It mentions the same test cases failing with the same error message about process exit codes. The state of that issue is \"open,\" so it's still being worked on. The reporter and assignee are both Daisy Den, which might be helpful for assigning ownership.\n\nAnother issue, #1173, involves a fatal Python error with an illegal instruction in a different test, but it's closed. Issue #645 is about test failures related to FP64 emulation and various other tests, but it's also closed. The other issues, #1472 and #1191, don't seem directly related to the problem at hand.\n\nSo, the most similar issue is definitely #1475. It's about the same test failing with the same error, so it's likely the same root cause. The fact that it's still open means it's a known issue that hasn't been resolved yet. The owner should probably be Daisy Den since she's handling #1475.\n\nThe root cause seems to be related to process exit codes during mixed precision testing on XPU. Maybe there's an issue with how processes are being joined or how their exit codes are being handled, especially under mixed precision conditions. The solution might involve debugging the `_join_processes` function to ensure that all processes exit with the expected codes, perhaps adding checks or handling exceptions more gracefully.\n\nI should suggest that the owner look into why process 1 is returning -11 instead of 0. Maybe there's an unhandled exception or a resource management issue. They could add logging to capture what's happening in process 1 and ensure that all processes terminate correctly. Also, reviewing the mixed precision setup might help, as the issue occurs during that phase of testing.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": 1475,\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"open\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"daisyden\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"Some test cases in test_fsdp_core.py are failing randomly in the _join_processes(fn) function during mixed precision testing on XPU.

There are three merged results: 221, 666, and 327. \n\nStarting with issue 221: It's about enabling mode support for XPU devices causing runtime errors. The tests for reductions on XPU failed because mode only supported CPU and CUDA. The error message was similar, mentioning device type 'xpu' not recognized. However, the current issue's error is about non-uniform work-groups, which doesn't seem related to device type recognition. So, probably not the same issue.\n\nNext, issue 666: This one involves test failures in XPU OP Extended UT on Windows. It mentions multiple test failures, including test_ops_xpu.py. The errors include tensor comparisons, device context issues, and unsupported operations. The reporter mentioned some failures could be fixed by rebasing or setting an environment variable. The error message here is about non-uniform work-groups, which might relate to how the XPU handles certain operations, possibly in the context of Windows. But the issue is closed, so maybe it's a known problem but not directly the same as the current issue.\n\nLooking at issue 327: This is about hard-coded CPU/CUDA bias in aten::mode_out, leading to a RuntimeError when using mode() on XPU. The error message here is different, focusing on mode support, so it's not related to the current issue's work-group problem.\n\nSo, none of the search results directly mention non-uniform work-groups. The closest is issue 666, which does involve test_ops_xpu.py failures but for different reasons. Therefore, the similar issue isn't found, so similar_issue_id and similar_issue_state should be N/A.\n\nNow, for the current issue, the owner could be the person who handled XPU issues before, maybe Stonepia or daisyden.

The error message says that for element 1, the expected shape was [4, 4, 3] but the actual shape was empty, which is [ ]. Hmm, that's a problem because the shapes don't match, causing the test to fail.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see three issues related to scaled dot product attention. The first one, issue 1432, is about SDPA outputs being NaN when rows are fully masked. It mentions a shape mismatch between meta and real implementations on XPU. The error message there is similar but not exactly the same as the one I'm seeing. It's about the output shape not matching, which is the same kind of issue.\n\nThen there's issue 1556, which is a NotImplementedError about a missing sharding strategy. That seems different because it's about distributed tensors and mixing Tensor and DTensor types. My error isn't about sharding or distributed operations, so maybe this isn't related.\n\nThe third issue, 1437, has the same error message as what I'm seeing: a shape mismatch between meta and real implementations. The root cause mentioned is a discrepancy in meta data versus the actual output. This seems very similar to my problem. The state is closed, which might mean it's been fixed, but I'm still encountering it.\n\nSo, comparing my issue to these, the most similar is issue 1437 because both involve a shape mismatch in the scaled dot product attention function. The root cause likely relates to how the meta data is generated versus the actual computation, possibly due to device differences like XPU. The solution might involve aligning the meta data with the real implementation, maybe by adjusting how the operation handles different devices or data types.\n\nI should probably look into how the meta data is being handled in the scaled_dot_product_attention function. Maybe there's an inconsistency when using the meta device versus other devices. Also, checking if there are any recent changes in the codebase that might have affected this, especially around XPU support or OneDNN versions.\n\nAnother angle is to see if the tensors involved are correctly converted or handled when on the meta device. Perhaps the function expects a certain shape but isn't getting it because of how the meta device processes the data. Testing with different device types or ensuring that the meta data aligns with real data might help.\n\nIn summary, the issue is likely due to a shape mismatch between the expected and actual outputs in the scaled dot product attention function, possibly related to device-specific handling.

Let me start by understanding the error message. It says there's an overflow when trying to convert a value to a float. That makes me think about data type handling, maybe something is trying to fit into a float when it's too big or not compatible.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see a few issues that mention similar errors. For example, issue 683 had a `RuntimeError` about converting a value to float without overflow in some complex tests. The root cause there was an explicit cast to float in MKLDNN's addbmm implementation. They fixed it by removing that cast and handling complex numbers properly. That seems relevant because the current issue also involves complex data types and a float conversion error.\n\nAnother issue, 436, talks about MKLDNN's addbmm not supporting complex and real data types. The error was similar, and the fix involved handling beta as a complex number instead of casting it to float. This aligns with the current problem, suggesting that the issue might be in how complex numbers are being handled in some operation, possibly involving MKLDNN.\n\nIssue 1198 dealt with dtype mismatches in the `pow` operation, but that's more about Float to Long conversions, which doesn't seem directly related here. Issues 676 and 435 are about other operations and might not be as relevant since they don't mention complex to float overflows.\n\nSo, putting this together, the current issue is likely due to improper handling of complex numbers being cast to float, causing overflow. The root cause is probably in how the data types are managed in the MKLDNN implementation, similar to issues 683 and 436. The solution would involve reviewing the code where complex numbers are being cast to float, ensuring that such casts are handled correctly or avoided when they can cause overflows.\n\nI should suggest looking into the MKLDNN implementation, specifically where complex data types are processed, to see if there's an explicit cast to float that's causing the overflow. Removing such casts or modifying how complex numbers are handled might resolve the issue. Assigning this to someone who works on MKLDNN, like ZhiweiYan-96, makes sense based on previous assignments.\n\nIn summary, the issue is likely due to improper type handling in MKLDNN when dealing with complex numbers, leading to a float overflow. The solution would involve correcting how these types are managed in the relevant code.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": 683,\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"closed\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"ZhiweiYan-96\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"TestMathBitsXPU failed with RuntimeError due to value overflow when converting complex numbers to float in addbmm operations.\",\n  \"root_causes\": [\n    \"Improper handling of complex numbers leading to float overflow during type conversion in MKLDNN's addbmm implementation.\"\n  ],\n  \"suggested_solutions\": [\n    \"Review and correct the type handling in MKLDNN's addbmm implementation to properly manage complex numbers, avoiding explicit float casts that cause overflow.\"\n  ]\n}\n```","audio":null},"finish_reason":"stop","metadata":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0}}

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that `test_ops_xpu.py` is a test file for PyTorch's XPU operations. The specific test `test_dtypes_fft_fft2_xpu` is probably testing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations on the XPU backend. The error message mentions that `torch.bfloat16` isn't working correctly during backpropagation, even though OpInfo lists it as supported.\n\nLooking at the search results, I see a few related issues. For example, issue 264 mentions problems with the XPU backend, including issues with data types and operations like sparse tensor creation. It also talks about `eq_xpu` not being implemented for `UInt16`, which caused some tests to fail. Another issue, 155, was about `index_add` returning the wrong dtype on XPU, which was fixed by ensuring the boolean dtype was preserved.\n\nIn the current problem, the issue is with `torch.bfloat16` not working in backward passes. Bfloat16 is a data type used for machine learning computations, and it's important that operations support it correctly, especially during backpropagation where gradients are computed.\n\nI think the root cause here might be that the FFT operations on XPU haven't been properly implemented or tested for `torch.bfloat16`. Maybe the backward pass for FFT isn't handling this data type correctly, or there's a missing implementation in the XPU backend for `fft.fft2` with `bfloat16`.\n\nLooking at the previous issues, like issue 264, the solution involved implementing missing operations and ensuring proper data type handling. Similarly, for this issue, the solution might involve adding support for `bfloat16` in the FFT operations on XPU. This could mean updating the ATen kernels or the dispatch stubs to handle `bfloat16` correctly during both forward and backward passes.\n\nI should also consider if there are any existing PRs or issues related to FFT operations on XPU. If not, perhaps the next step is to implement the necessary functions for `fft.fft2` with `bfloat16` and ensure that the backward pass is correctly handled. Additionally, adding tests to verify that `bfloat16` works as expected during backpropagation would be important to prevent similar issues in the future.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the issue is likely due to incomplete support for `bfloat16` in the FFT operations on XPU, leading to failures during the backward pass.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that this error message is related to PyTorch's Dynamo, which is a compiler for PyTorch graphs. When Dynamo encounters a function that it's marked as skipped, it can't compile that function, leading to this error. So, the test is failing because somewhere in the code, a function that's supposed to be skipped by Dynamo is being called, and that's causing an issue during the test.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's an existing issue number 1618 that's very similar. The description mentions that the error occurs in the same test case, `test_compiled_autograd_ctx`, and the error message is exactly the same. The issue is about the function `current_stream` in `torch/xpu/__init__.py` being skipped by Dynamo, which leads to an exception during backpropagation. The reporter is zxd1997066, and the assignee is guangyey. The issue is still open, so it hasn't been resolved yet.\n\nIn the comments of that issue, Daisyden suggested checking whether `torch.xpu.current_stream()` needs to be skipped during tracing. Guangyey agreed and proposed adding `torch.xpu.current_stream` to `torch_non_c_binding_in_graph_functions` in `trace_rules.py` to resolve the issue. This makes sense because if the function is added to that list, Dynamo would know to skip it, preventing the error.\n\nSo, the current issue I'm looking at seems to be the same as issue 1618. Both involve the same test failing with the same error message, and the root cause is the same function being skipped by Dynamo. The fact that the issue is still open means that it hasn't been fixed yet, so the test is failing because of this unresolved problem.\n\nI should consider who the owner of this issue is. From the search results, the assignee is guangyey, so that's likely the person responsible for fixing this. The issue description should mention that the test fails when trying to call a skipped function, and the root cause is that `current_stream` is marked as skipped, causing an exception during backpropagation.\n\nThe suggested solution, as per the comments, is to add `torch.xpu.current_stream` to the list of functions that Dynamo should skip. This would involve modifying `trace_rules.py` to include this function in `torch_non_c_binding_in_graph_functions`. This change would tell Dynamo to skip tracing this function, preventing the error during the test.\n\nI don't see any other issues that are similar to this one. The other search result, issue 1581, is about a segmentation fault in a different test, so it's unrelated. Therefore, the only similar issue is 1618, which is still open.\n\nIn summary, the failed test is a known issue, and the solution involves modifying the Dynamo configuration to skip the problematic function. The owner should be contacted to address this change.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": 1618,\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"open\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"guangyey\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"The test `test_compiled_autograd_ctx` fails due to an error when calling a function marked as skipped by PyTorch's Dynamo.

The test that failed is `test/distributed/test_inductor_collectives.py::TestCollectivesInductor::test_dynamo_rewrite_dist_all_gather`, and it's returning a fatal Python error: Segmentation fault. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the search results provided. There are three merged results: 1581, 861, and 1527. \n\nStarting with issue 1581, the description mentions a segmentation fault during the test `test_eager_async_allreduce_inductor_wait`. The error occurs in `test_inductor_collectives.py` at line 335, which is the same file as the current test. The issue involves a fatal Python error and mentions problems with distributed collective operations, C10D functional operations, and autograd issues. The root cause is likely improper handling of collective operations leading to segmentation faults.\n\nNext, issue 861 is about a segmentation fault in `test_torch_xpu.py::test_to_with_tensor`. It involves the TensorImpl destructor and tensor operations, especially in non-blocking mode. The reporter and assignee are mentioned, but the fix isn't detailed. This seems more related to XPU devices and tensor operations, which might not be directly related to the current test in distributed.py.\n\nIssue 1527 deals with an AttributeError related to `__enter__` in the contextlib module during distributed testing. It's about Dynamo failing to trace certain operators, which doesn't seem to directly relate to the segmentation fault in the current issue.\n\nThe current test failure is in `test_inductor_collectives.py`, which is the same file as issue 1581. Both involve distributed collective operations and segmentation faults. The current test is `test_dynamo_rewrite_dist_all_gather`, which might involve similar distributed operations as the allreduce test in issue 1581. The root cause in 1581 was improper handling of collective operations, leading to a segmentation fault. \n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the current issue is similar to issue 1581. The root cause likely involves issues with how collective operations are handled in the distributed testing framework, possibly related to C10D or autograd. The suggested solution would involve reviewing the handling of these operations, ensuring proper synchronization, and checking for any unhandled exceptions or improper resource management that could lead to segmentation faults.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": 1581,\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"Open\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"daniekap\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"Fatal Python error: Segmentation fault occurred during the execution of test_dynamo_rewrite_dist_all_gather in test/distributed/test_inductor_collectives.py.

Let me start by understanding the error message and then look into the provided search results to see if this is a known issue.\n\nThe error message says that the operator isn't implemented for XPU, which means the code is trying to use this operator on an XPU device but it's not available there. This is causing the test to fail because it can't proceed as expected. The test is part of the `MicroPipelineTPTest` class, which suggests it's related to distributed tensor parallelism, a common area for such issues.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are two relevant issues: 1551 and 1547. Both involve similar errors with operators not being implemented on XPU. Issue 1551 mentions `fused_scaled_matmul_reduce_scatter`, while issue 1547 is about `fused_matmul_reduce_scatter`. The current test failure is for `fused_matmul_reduce_scatter`, which matches issue 1547 exactly.\n\nIn issue 1547, the problem is that the operator isn't implemented for XPU, leading to test failures in distributed tensor parallelism tests. The assignee is Chao1Han, and the issue is still open. The root cause is the missing implementation of the operator on XPU, which causes the tests to fallback to CPU, affecting performance.\n\nSo, putting this together, the current test failure is a duplicate of issue 1547. The operator in question isn't implemented for XPU, leading to the same kind of test failures as previously documented. The state of the issue is open, meaning it hasn't been resolved yet.\n\nTo summarize, the failed test is encountering a known issue where the required operator isn't supported on XPU.

Let me start by looking at the information provided.\n\nFirst, the error message is `RuntimeError: Process 0 terminated or timed out after 300.09047198295593 seconds`. That suggests the test is taking too long or something is causing it to hang. The test in question is part of the distributed testing, specifically involving object collectives on CPU.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a similar issue with issue number 1535. The description mentions a `RuntimeError` related to process termination or timeout, specifically in distributed testing with oneCCL. The problem was traced back to the Gather OP, where the output didn't match expected values, leading to assertion errors. The solution involved updating to the latest oneCCL master and adjusting the test environment.\n\nAnother relevant result is issue 1598, which had an `UR_RESULT_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY` error. However, that was resolved by updating memory management in distributed collectives, which might not be directly related to the timeout issue.\n\nIssue 1581 involved a segmentation fault during a test, but that's a different kind of error, so probably not related here.\n\nSo, focusing on issue 1535, the root cause was a bug in the Gather operation when using the latest oneCCL master. The fix was to update oneCCL and adjust the environment. Since the current issue is also a timeout in a gather operation, it's likely related.\n\nI should consider that the Gather OP might have a regression in the oneCCL master branch, causing the test to hang or take too long. The test passes with the gold release but fails with the master, which points to a recent change causing the issue.\n\nThe owner for issue 1535 was `ratnampa`, so it's reasonable to assign this new issue to them as well. The root cause would be a similar problem with the Gather OP in the distributed environment, possibly due to synchronization issues or incorrect memory handling.\n\nTo fix this, updating to the latest oneCCL master and ensuring the test environment is correctly set up should help.

The error message says something about oneCCL not supporting the average operation for the scheduler path. Hmm, I've seen similar errors before. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the error message is a RuntimeError pointing to oneCCL's coll_param.cpp file. It mentions that the average operation isn't supported in the scheduler path. That sounds familiar. I remember there were some issues in the past where certain operations weren't supported, leading to test failures.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are a couple of similar issues. Issue 1559 and 1508 both have the same error message. Both are related to the average operation not being supported. Issue 1559 is closed, which probably means it was fixed. Issue 1508 is still open but mentions problems with INT64 dtype and average operations. The resolution for 1508 involved updating to the latest oneCCL master, which suggests that the issue might have been fixed in a newer version.\n\nThe current test failure is in test/distributed/_tools/test_fsdp2_mem_tracker.py, specifically when using activation checkpointing. The error is the same as in the past issues, so it's likely related to the same root cause.\n\nSo, the root cause seems to be that the average operation isn't implemented or supported in the scheduler path of oneCCL. This could be because the scheduler path doesn't handle average operations, maybe due to missing code or an incomplete implementation.\n\nNow, thinking about the solution. Since issue 1508 was resolved by updating to the latest oneCCL master, maybe the same approach would work here. Updating the oneCCL library might include fixes for the average operation support. Alternatively, there might be a way to adjust the test to avoid using the unsupported path, but that's probably less ideal.\n\nI should also consider if there are any workarounds or alternative approaches. Maybe the test can be modified to use a different collective operation that's supported, but that might require changes in the test code itself.\n\nIn terms of ownership, the assignees from the past issues were daisyden and ratnampa. It might be best to assign this to one of them, perhaps ratnampa since they handled a similar issue before.\n\nPutting it all together, the issue is likely a known problem related to oneCCL's support for average operations. The solution would involve updating the oneCCL library to the latest version where this issue has been fixed. Alternatively, if that's not possible, adjusting the test to avoid the problematic operation might be necessary.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": 1508,\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"open\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"ratnampa\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"RuntimeError: oneCCL: coll_param.cpp:455 validate: EXCEPTION: average operation is not supported for the scheduler path\",\n  \"root_causes\": [\"The average operation is not implemented or supported in the scheduler path of the oneCCL library used by PyTorch's distributed functions.
