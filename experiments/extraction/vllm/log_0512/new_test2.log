The test that failed is `test_gemm_bias_offline_tunableop_xpu_bfloat16` in `third_party.torch-xpu-ops.test.xpu.test_linalg_xpu.TestLinalgXPU`. The error message is `AssertionError: Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled.` \n\nFirst, I'll look through the provided search results to see if there are any similar issues. \n\nLooking at the first result, issue 780, it's about a dtype mismatch between XPU and CPU outputs. The error was about float32 vs bfloat16. The test was skipped because of a similar CUDA issue. That doesn't seem directly related to the current error, which is about Torch not being compiled with CUDA enabled.\n\nThe second result is issue 1229. The error message here is about CUDA being unavailable when XPU is requested. The issue was fixed by modifying device selection logic. This seems relevant because the current error is also about Torch not having CUDA enabled, which might be a similar problem when using XPU.\n\nIssue 1222 is about multiple models failing accuracy tests with specific precisions. The root cause was a commit, but the error message doesn't match the current issue.\n\nIssue 302 is about various test failures, including some related to XPU and CUDA functions. It mentions missing attributes and functions, but the error message here is about CUDA not being enabled, which might be related but not the same as the current issue.\n\nSo, the most relevant issue seems to be 1229. Both issues involve problems when using XPU and CUDA. In 1229, the problem was that the code was incorrectly checking for CUDA availability when XPU was used. The fix was to adjust the device selection logic.\n\nTherefore, the current issue is likely similar to 1229. The error occurs because the test is expecting CUDA to be enabled, but it's running on XPU. The solution would be to modify the test to correctly handle XPU devices without requiring CUDA.\n\nThe owner should probably be the person who handled issue 1229, which was mengfei25. The root cause is that the test assumes CUDA is available, which isn't the case when running on XPU. The solution is to adjust the device checks in the test setup.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": 1229,\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"closed\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"mengfei25\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"Unit test third_party.torch-xpu-ops.test.xpu.test_linalg_xpu.TestLinalgXPU.test_gemm_bias_offline_tunableop_xpu_bfloat16 failed with AssertionError: Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled.\",\n  \"root_causes\": [\"The test incorrectly assumes CUDA availability when running on XPU, leading to an error since CUDA is not enabled.\"],\n  \"suggested_solutions\": [\"Modify the test to correctly handle XPU devices without requiring CUDA.\"]\n}\n```","audio":null},"finish_reason":"stop","metadata":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0}}

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the error message. It says that the module `torch._C` doesn't have an attribute `_cuda_tunableop_enable`. That suggests that somewhere in the test code, there's a call to `torch._C._cuda_tunableop_enable()`, but that function doesn't exist in the current version of PyTorch.\n\nI remember that in PyTorch, some internal functions are prefixed with underscores, like `_C`, which means they're part of the C extensions. These functions are usually not meant for public use and can change between versions. So, if the test is trying to call a function that's not available, it's probably because either the function was never implemented or it's been removed or renamed in a newer version.\n\nLooking at the search results provided, there are two relevant issues: 223 and 246. \n\nIssue 223 is about an `AttributeError` related to `_set_cached_tensors_enabled`. The resolution mentioned that this API is specific to `CUDAGraph` and not needed for the current unit tests. So, they decided not to refactor unless there's a real need. This makes me think that sometimes, these internal functions are tied to specific features and might not be available in all contexts.\n\nIssue 246 deals with multiple errors in `test_autograd_xpu.py`, including some missing attributes and not implemented errors. Some of these were fixed, but others remain. This shows that there are ongoing issues with the XPU tests, possibly due to incomplete support or missing implementations.\n\nNow, focusing back on the current issue. The test is in `test_linalg_xpu.py`, which suggests it's related to linear algebra operations on XPU devices. The error is about `_cuda_tunableop_enable`, which seems to be a function that's supposed to enable some tunable operations, perhaps for optimization purposes.\n\nI wonder if `_cuda_tunableop_enable` is part of the CUDA-specific code and not meant to be called from XPU tests. Maybe the test was written assuming that this function exists, but in reality, it's either not implemented or only available for CUDA and not XPU.\n\nAnother possibility is that the function was removed or renamed in a recent update. If the codebase was updated, some internal functions might have been deprecated or replaced, leading to this error.\n\nLooking at the root causes from the previous issues, it seems that missing attributes in `torch.xpu` and incomplete support for certain operations are common problems. So, it's possible that `_cuda_tunableop_enable` is either not implemented for XPU or was mistakenly included in the test without proper support.\n\nThe suggested solutions from the past issues often involve refactoring tests to avoid using such internal functions unless necessary, or implementing the missing functionality if it's required. Since the test is failing because it's trying to access a non-existent function, the solution might involve removing the call or finding an alternative way to achieve the same result without using `_cuda_tunableop_enable`.\n\nAlternatively, if the function is necessary, the team might need to implement it for XPU support, but that would require more resources and time. Given that the previous issue 223 was closed without action because the API wasn't needed, it's possible that this function isn't essential for the current use case, and the test can be adjusted to not rely on it.\n\nIn summary, the most likely cause is that the test is incorrectly assuming the presence of `_cuda_tunableop_enable`, which doesn't exist or isn't available in the current setup. The solution would be to modify the test to remove this dependency or find an alternative approach that doesn't require this function.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": \"N/A\",\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"N/A\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"daisyden\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"The unit test `test_gemm_bias_tunableop_xpu_bfloat16` is failing due to an `AttributeError` indicating that the module `torch._C` lacks the attribute `_cuda_tunableop_enable`.

The first one is issue 1521, which mentions enabling PyTorch Flex Attention on XPU failing with a similar error about Torch not being compiled with CUDA enabled. The second is issue 302, which is about various test failures in the test_torch.py framework, including issues with XPU support and missing attributes.\n\nThe error message in the current test failure is the same as in issue 1521. Both involve an assertion error related to Torch not being compiled with CUDA enabled, even though the tests are running on XPU. This suggests that the problem might be related to how Torch is handling XPU devices, possibly not enabling necessary CUDA components or missing some backend support.\n\nIn issue 1521, the root cause was that FlexAttention wasn't enabled on XPU yet, targeting Torch 2.8. The solution mentioned was to enable it in that version. For the current issue, the problem might be similar—maybe the Scaled GEMM operation isn't properly supported on XPU, or the necessary CUDA components aren't being linked or enabled when running on XPU.\n\nLooking at issue 302, there were multiple test failures due to missing XPU support in various functions and attributes. This could indicate broader issues with XPU compatibility in Torch, which might also affect the current test. However, the specific error in the current test is more aligned with issue 1521.\n\nSo, the likely root cause is that the Scaled GEMM operation isn't properly supported or enabled on XPU, possibly due to missing CUDA components or incomplete backend integration.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the error message is pointing to an issue with the module `torch._C` not having an attribute `_cuda_tunableop_enable`. This suggests that somewhere in the test code, there's a call to this attribute, but it's not found. \n\nLooking at the search results provided, there are two relevant issues: 223 and 246. \n\nIssue 223 is about an `AttributeError` related to `_set_cached_tensors_enabled`. The resolution mentioned that this API is specific to `CUDAGraph` and not needed for the current tests. So, the solution was to refactor the code, but only if there's a real need for it. This suggests that sometimes, certain attributes in `torch._C` are not meant for general use and might be removed or not present in all builds.\n\nIssue 246 reports several problems in `test_autograd_xpu.py`, including issues with missing attributes in `torch.xpu` and other errors. Some of these were fixed, but others remain unresolved. This indicates that there might be ongoing issues with the XPU module's completeness or compatibility.\n\nNow, looking at the current issue, the error is about `_cuda_tunableop_enable`. I'm not immediately familiar with this attribute, but given the pattern from issue 223, it's possible that this attribute is either deprecated, not meant for public use, or only included in certain builds (like those with CUDA support). \n\nIf `_cuda_tunableop_enable` is part of the CUDA-specific APIs, it might not be available when running tests that don't require or don't properly set up CUDA context. Alternatively, it could be that the test is trying to access an internal attribute that's not exposed in the current version of PyTorch or the XPU ops.\n\nAnother angle is that the test might be incorrectly assuming the presence of this attribute. Maybe it's trying to enable some tunable op functionality that hasn't been properly integrated into the XPU backend yet. This could be a missing implementation detail, similar to some of the issues in 246 where certain operations aren't implemented for XPU.\n\nI should also consider whether the test is correctly handling the XPU devices or if there's a setup issue. Maybe the test isn't initializing CUDA or XPU properly before running, leading to the attribute not being available.\n\nLooking at the root causes from the previous issues, common problems included missing CUDA support, missing attributes in `torch.xpu`, and unimplemented operations. So, it's possible that `_cuda_tunableop_enable` is either not implemented for XPU or is part of a feature that's not yet supported.\n\nTo resolve this, I might need to check if `_cuda_tunableop_enable` is a legitimate API that should be accessible in the current setup. If it's not, perhaps the test should be modified to not rely on it or to handle its absence gracefully. Alternatively, if this attribute is necessary, there might be a need to implement or enable it within the XPU backend, similar to how some issues in 246 were resolved by adding support for missing features.\n\nI should also look into whether other tests have encountered similar issues and how they were resolved. For example, in issue 223, the solution involved refactoring the test to avoid using the specific API. Maybe a similar approach is needed here, such as removing the dependency on `_cuda_tunableop_enable` if it's not essential for the test's purpose.\n\nIn summary, the likely causes are that the attribute is either not available because it's not implemented for XPU or it's an internal CUDA-specific attribute that shouldn't be used here. The solution might involve modifying the test to remove the dependency on this attribute or implementing the necessary support in the XPU backend if it's required.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": \"N/A\",\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"N/A\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"daisyden\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"The unit test `test_scaled_gemm_tunableop_xpu_float8_e5m2fnuz` is failing due to an `AttributeError` related to the missing `_cuda_tunableop_enable` attribute in `torch._C`.

The test that failed is `test_transformerencoder_fastpath_use_torchscript_False_enable_nested_tensor_False_use_autocast_True_d_model_12_xpu`, and it's returning a `RuntimeError: output 1: meta disagrees with real impl`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the provided search results to see if there are any similar issues. \n\nLooking at Merged Result 601, the issue description mentions several test failures in `torch-xpu-ops`, specifically in `test_meta` tests. The errors include `RuntimeError` related to meta disagreements, which is exactly what the current test is failing with. The issue was closed, and the assignee was `fengyuan14`. The error messages listed include `test_dispatch_meta_outplace__foreach_norm_xpu_bfloat16` and others, which suggests issues with how the XPU backend handles certain operations during meta testing.\n\nAnother point in issue 601 is that there were problems with functions like `Pow`, `Addbmm`, and `Nanmean`, indicating issues with their implementation or support on XPU. The resolution involved adding certain functions to the computation op list, which implies that some operations weren't properly supported, leading to test failures.\n\nNow, looking at Merged Result 645, the issue is about test failures related to FP64 emulation. The errors here are different, involving `test_compare_cpu__refs_rsub_xpu_float16` and others, but it's also a test failure in the XPU tests. However, the error messages here don't mention meta disagreements, so it's less likely related to the current issue.\n\nThe current test failure is in `test_transformers_xpu`, specifically in `TestTransformersXPU`. The error is about a meta disagreement, which aligns with the issues described in Merged Result 601. The fact that the error message mentions `output 1: meta disagrees with real impl` is a strong indicator that this is related to how the XPU backend is handling the computation's metadata, similar to the problems reported in issue 601.\n\nGiven that, it's reasonable to conclude that this is a similar issue. The root cause likely involves a mismatch between the expected and actual implementations of certain operations on the XPU, possibly due to missing or incorrect implementations in the XPU backend. The solution would involve reviewing the transformer encoder's implementation on XPU, ensuring that all operations are correctly handled, and adding any missing functions to the computation op list if necessary.\n\nThe owner of this issue would probably be the same as in issue 601, which was `fengyuan14`, as they were assigned to resolve the previous meta-related issues. Alternatively, if they're no longer available, another maintainer like `daisyden` might take over, as seen in issue 645.\n\nIn summary, the failed test is likely a known issue related to meta handling in XPU operations, similar to issue 601, and the solution would involve addressing the underlying implementation gaps in the XPU backend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": 601,\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"closed\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"fengyuan14\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"The test `test_transformerencoder_fastpath_use_torchscript_False_enable_nested_tensor_False_use_autocast_True_d_model_12_xpu` failed with a `RuntimeError: output 1: meta disagrees with real impl`.

The first one is issue 1437, which also has a RuntimeError about meta data shape mismatch. It mentions that the expected shape was [4,4,3] but got an empty shape. The root cause was incorrect meta data or device type handling, especially with XPU. That seems relevant because our test is also on XPU and involves meta data.\n\nThen there's issue 601, which has multiple test failures related to meta disagreements and unsupported device types. It mentions functions like Pow and Addbmm having issues. The reporter also saw errors in test_dispatch_meta_outplace functions, similar to what we're seeing. This makes me think that there might be a broader issue with how certain operations are handled on XPU, affecting multiple tests.\n\nIssue 1478 is about test failures on Windows, but it's more about device support and process initialization. It doesn't seem directly related to the meta data issue we're facing, so I can probably set that aside.\n\nSo, the main similar issues are 1437 and 601. Both involve meta data discrepancies and XPU operations. The root causes likely involve incorrect meta data generation or device type handling.

The issue is open, and the error message mentions tensor-like mismatches with high percentages. The problem there seems to be related to precision handling on the XPU, which is similar to the current issue.

The owner should probably be the assignee from the similar issues, like daisyden or RUIJIEZHONG66166, who have handled such problems before.\n\nThe root cause is probably the same as in the closed issue: discrepancies in how certain operations are performed on XPU versus CPU, leading to tensor values that are close numerically but not exactly matching within the allowed error margins.

However, the root cause in those cases often involved missing XPU backend support or incorrect tensor operations.\n\nSo, the likely root cause here is that the MaxUnpool function isn't correctly validating the indices on the XPU device, leading to the error not being raised as expected. The solution would involve implementing the necessary checks in the XPU backend to ensure that the indices are within the valid range before proceeding with the pooling operation.\n\nI should suggest that the owner of the pooling operations in the XPU backend look into this. They should add the necessary validation checks to trigger the expected error when the indices are invalid. This would align with how such validations are handled on other devices like CPU or CUDA.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": \"N/A\",\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"N/A\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \" pooling_operations_owner\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"The test_MaxUnpool_index_errors_case1_xpu is failing with an AssertionError because the expected error message 'maxind >= 0 && maxind < outputImageSize' was not found.

The test that's failing is test_maxpool3d_non_square_backward_xpu, and it's returning a RuntimeError with the message \"UR error.\" \n\nLooking at the search results provided, there are three issues mentioned: 771, 1192, and 645. Let me go through each one to see if they're related.\n\nIssue 771 is about problems in test_pooling_xpu.py. It mentions two types of errors: a RuntimeError for 'avg_pool3d_out_frame' not being implemented for 'BFloat16' and another RuntimeError for 'adaptive_max_pool3d_cpu' not being implemented for 'Half'. The tests affected include test_pooling_bfloat16_xpu, test_pool_large_size_xpu_bfloat16, and several others. The state of this issue is closed. \n\nThe current issue is in the same test file, test_pooling_xpu.py, but the specific test is test_maxpool3d_non_square_backward_xpu. The error message here is a generic \"RuntimeError: UR error,\" which doesn't specify exactly what's wrong, unlike the more detailed messages in issue 771. However, both issues are in the same test file and involve pooling operations, so there might be a connection. It's possible that the underlying problem is related to the implementation of maxpool3d on XPU, similar to how avg_pool3d and adaptive_max_pool3d had issues with certain data types.\n\nIssue 1192 is about a failing test in test_rnn_backward_to_input_but_not_parameters_xpu. The error is a NotImplementedError for 'aten::_thnn_fused_lstm_cell' not being available on CPU. This seems unrelated because it's a different test and involves an LSTM cell, not pooling operations. So, probably not related to the current issue.\n\nIssue 645 is about test failures related to FP64 emulation. It mentions several test cases failing, but the specific test here is about maxpool3d, which isn't listed among the failed tests in issue 645. The root cause mentioned is discrepancies in FP64 emulation, which doesn't directly relate to the current error. So, this might not be the same issue.\n\nPutting this together, the most similar issue is 771 because both involve test failures in test_pooling_xpu.py. The current issue's test is about maxpool3d, which wasn't specifically mentioned in issue 771, but the fact that both are in the same test file and involve pooling operations suggests a possible link. The root cause in issue 771 was that certain pooling functions weren't implemented for specific data types. It's possible that in the current issue, the maxpool3d function isn't implemented correctly for XPU, leading to the RuntimeError.\n\nThe owner for issue 771 was chunhuanMeng, so it's reasonable to suggest them as the owner for this issue as well. The root cause might be that the maxpool3d operation isn't properly implemented or optimized for XPU, leading to the runtime error. The solution would involve implementing or optimizing the maxpool3d function for XPU, possibly adding support for non-square kernels or adjusting how the backward pass is handled on XPU.\n\nI should note that the error message in the current issue is more generic, so without more details, it's a bit speculative.

Let me start by understanding the error message and then see if it relates to any known issues.\n\nThe error message says there's a mismatch in tensor values, specifically mentioning that 416 out of 8192 elements are mismatched, which is about 5.1%. The greatest absolute difference is 0.002694, and the relative difference is 10.97%. Both of these exceed the allowed tolerance of 0.001. This seems significant, so I need to find if there's a similar issue reported before.\n\nLooking through the search results, I see two relevant issues. The first is issue 1237, which also involves test failures in test_native_mha_xpu.py, specifically with float16 precision. The error messages there mention similar percentages of mismatched elements and absolute/relative differences. The reporter is the same, daisyden, and the issue is marked as closed, which means it was resolved.\n\nThe second issue, 1400, is about a different test, test_rms_norm.py, failing with a similar tensor-like error but under different conditions (bfloat16 dtype). The reporter is different, and the issue is still open. Since the test names and contexts are different, this might not be directly related to the current problem.\n\nGiven that the current test failure involves float16 precision and the same test file, issue 1237 is the most relevant. The root cause there was identified as precision handling discrepancies between CPU and XPU, leading to tensor comparison failures. The solution involved revising the functions to ensure accurate comparisons, aligning outputs within the allowed error margins.\n\nSo, the current issue is likely a duplicate of issue 1237, which has already been resolved.

Let me start by understanding the error message. It says the tensors aren't close enough, which usually means there's a discrepancy in the values they're holding. \n\nLooking at the search results, I see a few similar issues. The first one is issue 236, which had problems with test cases involving RReLU and max_unpool1d functions on XPU. The error messages there also mentioned tensor-like mismatches, with specific differences in elements. The root cause was traced back to precision handling issues on the XPU, especially with automatic differentiation. They fixed it by adjusting how operations were handled on the XPU to match CPU results better.\n\nAnother issue mentioned is related to the exp function, specifically in test 1195. The error there involved the exp function not producing the expected results on XPU, leading to tensor mismatches. The root cause was identified as an issue with how the exp function was implemented or handled on the XPU, possibly due to numerical precision differences or incorrect computations for extreme values.\n\nNow, the current test failure is in `test_reference_numerics_extremal_exp_xpu_complex64`. The word \"extremal\" suggests it's testing the exp function with extreme values, maybe very large or very small numbers, which can be tricky for numerical computations. The fact that it's using complex64 numbers adds another layer of complexity because handling complex numbers can introduce more precision issues.\n\nI'm thinking the problem might be related to how the exp function handles these extreme values on the XPU. Maybe the computation isn't precise enough, leading to small differences in the tensor values compared to the expected CPU results. The error message mentions a 0.000640869140625 absolute difference, which is within the allowed 0.0001, but perhaps the test is more sensitive or there's a pattern in the failing cases.\n\nLooking at the previous issues, especially issue 1195, which was about the exp function, it's likely that the same underlying problem is causing this test to fail. The root cause might be in the implementation of the exp function on the XPU, particularly when dealing with complex numbers and extreme inputs. The precision handling during the computation could be introducing these small but significant discrepancies.\n\nTo fix this, the team probably needs to revisit the implementation of the exp function for complex numbers on the XPU. They might need to adjust how they compute the exponential for extreme values to ensure the results align more closely with CPU computations. This could involve optimizing the numerical methods used or adjusting the precision handling in those specific cases.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other functions or operations that interact with the exp function on the XPU that might be contributing to the issue. Maybe there's a bug in how gradients or automatic differentiation is handled, similar to issue 236. Ensuring that the forward and backward passes are correctly implemented and that the results match expected CPU outputs would be crucial.\n\nIn summary, the likely root cause is a precision or implementation issue in the exp function for complex numbers on the XPU, especially when handling extreme values. The solution would involve refining the exp function's implementation to handle these cases more accurately, possibly by adjusting numerical computations or precision settings during the function's execution on the XPU.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": 1195,\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"closed\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"gaopengff\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"The test `test_reference_numerics_extremal_exp_xpu_complex64` is failing due to tensor-like value mismatches, indicating issues with the exp function's implementation on XPU, particularly with complex64 numbers and extreme values.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the error message: `NotImplementedError: Could not run 'aten::_thnn_fused_lstm_cell' with arguments from the 'CPU' backend.` This tells me that the test is trying to run on the CPU, but the operator isn't available there.

The error message is an `AssertionError: Tensor-likes are not close!`, which suggests that the tensors being compared have values that are not matching as expected.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are a couple of similar issues. The first one is issue 236, which had problems with test cases related to `RReLU` and `max_unpool1d` functions on XPU. The errors there involved significant differences in tensor elements, with high absolute and relative differences. The root cause was traced to precision handling discrepancies between CPU and XPU operations, leading to test failures despite passing PRECI reports.\n\nAnother issue mentioned is related to the `exp` function, tracked in #1195. This issue was closed and the root cause was specific to that function, suggesting that the problem was isolated and fixed.\n\nNow, the current test failure is in `test_reference_numerics_small_acos_xpu_complex32`. The function `acos` is the inverse cosine function, which is a unary ufunc. The test is failing because the computed tensor values aren't close enough to the expected ones.\n\nComparing this to the previous issues, the root causes were related to precision handling and specific function implementations on XPU. The `acos` function might have similar precision issues when handling complex numbers on XPU. The test is likely comparing the computed results from XPU with CPU references, and there's a discrepancy beyond the allowed error margin.\n\nThe owner for such issues is probably the PyTorch XPU team, specifically those handling numerical accuracy and unary functions. The issue owner could be someone like `gaopengff` who was assigned in the previous issues.\n\nThe root cause here is likely due to differences in how `acos` is implemented or optimized on XPU compared to CPU. There might be precision loss or different approximation methods used on XPU that lead to these discrepancies. Additionally, the handling of complex numbers could introduce more complexity, possibly leading to more pronounced differences.\n\nTo fix this, the implementation of `acos` on XPU needs to be reviewed. It might require adjusting the precision handling, ensuring that the computations align more closely with CPU results, or tweaking the tolerance levels in the tests if the differences are within acceptable bounds. Alternatively, there might be a bug in the XPU kernel that needs correction to match the expected outputs.\n\nIn summary, the issue is similar to previous precision-related test failures on XPU, pointing to the need for a detailed review of the `acos` function's implementation and its numerical handling on XPU devices.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": \"236\",\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"closed\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"gaopengff\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"The test `test_reference_numerics_small_acos_xpu_complex32` is failing due to tensor-like values not being close enough.

The first one is issue 236, which also has the same error message about tensors not being close. The problem there was with specific test cases involving RReLU and max_unpool1d functions on XPU.

The error message there mentions a lot more mismatched elements, 559 out of 640, which is a much higher rate than the current test failure.

The root cause is probably the same: differences in how operations are handled on CPU vs. XPU leading to precision mismatches.

The error message says that the assertion expected \"the 'out' tensor was specified and requires gradients\" but got \"cannot resize variables that require grad\" instead. Hmm, that's confusing. \n\nFirst, I remember that in PyTorch, when you use autograd, it keeps track of tensors that require gradients for backpropagation. So, if a tensor is part of the computation graph, it needs to have gradients. Now, the test is failing because the error message doesn't match what was expected. The test was probably written to check for a specific error when using `out` tensors with autograd, but it's getting a different one.\n\nLooking at the error messages from similar issues, I see that there were problems with tensor operations and device type mismatches, especially between CPU and XPU. For example, there was an issue where the multinomial function expected a CPU generator but got an XPU one. That suggests that device handling might be a common problem, especially when dealing with operations that require gradients.\n\nIn this case, the error is about resizing variables that require gradients. I know that in PyTorch, once a tensor is added to the computation graph (i.e., requires gradients), you can't change its size because autograd relies on the computation history. So, if the test is trying to resize an 'out' tensor that requires gradients, it's causing an error. But why is the error message different from what the test expects?\n\nMaybe the test was written expecting a different kind of error. It was probably designed to catch cases where an 'out' tensor is specified but requires gradients, which isn't allowed because the 'out' tensor should be a new tensor without gradients. But instead, the error is about resizing, which implies that the tensor is being modified in place after being marked to require gradients.\n\nI should check how the test is structured. It's in `test_linalg_xpu`, so it's testing some linear algebra operations on XPU devices. The test is probably creating a tensor, enabling autograd, and then trying to perform an operation that uses an 'out' tensor. If the 'out' tensor is supposed to be a new tensor without gradients, but it's somehow still requiring gradients, that could cause issues.\n\nWait, the error message says \"cannot resize variables that require grad.\" That makes me think that somewhere, the code is trying to resize a tensor that's part of the computation graph. Maybe the 'out' tensor is being used in a way that autograd doesn't expect, like trying to modify it in place after it's been used in a computation.\n\nLooking at similar issues, there were problems with inplace operations causing issues with autograd. For example, in issue 727, there was an error because an inplace operation was causing the tensor's state to change during the backward pass. So, maybe in this test, the 'out' tensor is being modified in place, which autograd doesn't allow.\n\nSo, the root cause might be that the 'out' tensor is being used in a way that autograd isn't handling correctly, perhaps due to how the XPU backend handles tensor operations. The test expects a certain error message but gets a different one because the actual issue is with resizing a tensor that requires gradients.\n\nTo fix this, maybe the test needs to be adjusted to expect the correct error message. Alternatively, the code might need to ensure that the 'out' tensor doesn't require gradients or that it's handled in a way that autograd can manage without resizing issues.\n\nI should also consider if there are any missing implementations in the XPU backend. From the search results, there were issues with missing functions and attributes, like 'is_xpu' not being implemented. Maybe the 'out' tensor handling isn't fully supported on XPU, leading to these errors.\n\nIn summary, the test is failing because the error message doesn't match expectations, likely due to how autograd interacts with 'out' tensors on XPU. The issue might stem from how tensors are resized or modified after being marked for gradients, possibly due to incomplete XPU backend support or incorrect test expectations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": \"N/A\",\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"N/A\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"daisyden\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"The unit test `torch-xpu-ops.test.xpu.test_linalg_xpu.TestLinalgXPU.test_tensordot_out_kernel_errors_with_autograd_xpu_float32` is failing due to an assertion error.

Hmm, I remember reading somewhere that some PyTorch operations aren't implemented for XPU. Let me check the search results.\n\nLooking at the first result, it mentions implementing missing XPU backend functions and attributes. They fixed some tests by adding the 'is_xpu' flag and handling scalar type mismatches. That seems related but not exactly the same as the current issue.\n\nThe second result is issue 144, which talks about supporting more ATen operators for XPU. The error there was about '_local_scalar_dense' not being implemented. They suggested opening an issue on torch-xpu-ops for priority. The third result is issue 1576, which is about '_conv_depthwise2d' not being implemented, leading to Huggingface Transformers tests failing. They reverted a commit because the XPU operator wasn't ready.\n\nWait, the current error is about '_conv_depthwise2d' again. So it's the same operator as in issue 1576. The state of that issue is closed, so maybe it's been resolved before. But the user is encountering it again. Maybe the fix wasn't complete or a regression happened.\n\nThe root cause in issue 1576 was a commit that introduced a dependency without the XPU operator being ready. They had to revert the commit. So perhaps the same problem is happening now.

The error message is a RuntimeError saying that the difference between the decomposition and the original for nll_loss_backward is larger than expected. The original max diff is 0.0, but the decomposition gives 0.4765625. \n\nLooking at the search results, I see a few relevant issues. The first one is issue 918, which mentions a RuntimeError for nll_loss2d_backward with a larger difference when using decomposition. It's closed, so maybe the problem was fixed, but perhaps similar issues are still present. \n\nThen there's issue 227, which is about the same test failing because of a precision issue with nll_loss2d_backward. The problem was due to the atol being too high, and they adjusted it to match the forward pass. They also mentioned using O0 optimization instead of O3. \n\nIssue 184 talks about accuracy issues with various operations, including complex numbers and bfloat16. It seems like some operations have precision problems, possibly related to the hardware or compiler.\n\nSo, the current issue is similar to 918 and 227 because they all involve nll_loss_backward and decomposition issues. The root cause might be related to the atol setting or the compiler optimization level. \n\nI think the owner should be the person who handled issue 227, maybe huaiyuzh, since they dealt with the atol adjustment. The issue description should mention the test failure and the specific error message. The root cause is likely the atol being too high or compiler optimizations affecting precision. The solution would be to adjust the atol and maybe switch to O0 optimization, similar to what was done in 227.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"similar_issue_id\": 918,\n  \"similar_issue_state\": \"closed\",\n  \"issue_owner\": \"huaiyuzh\",\n  \"issue_description\": \"The unit test test_decomp.py::TestDecompXPU::test_comprehensive_nn_functional_cross_entropy_xpu_bfloat16 failed with a RuntimeError indicating a larger difference between the decomposition and original nll_loss_backward results.
